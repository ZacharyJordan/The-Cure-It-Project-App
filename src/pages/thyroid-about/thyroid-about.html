    <p class = "whiten">
     Thyroid Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable growth of cells in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located just below the center of the neck.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      There are 3 different types of Thyroid Cancers: Papillary Carcinomas, Follicular Carcinomas, and Hurthle Cell Carcinomas.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
  The thyroid is essentially a large ductless gland in the neck that secretes special hormones that control certain aspects of growth through manipulating the rate of metabolism. Cancer of the thyroid is fairly common relative to other cancers, and scientists are still trying to unravel the mystery of what causes it.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Fortunately, the largely visible symptoms of Thyroid Cancer make eary detection fairly easy, something which means that the vast majority of people who contract the disease eventually make a significant recovery.
