     Liver Cancers are cancers that involve the growth and spread of abnormal cells in the liver. There are several different types of Liver Cancer, all of which possess different characteristics and require a different approach in treatment.

  The liver is often noted as being one of the most important organs in the body. It processes substances such as food and drink into valuable energy and nutrients that the body can store for later, and is involved with removing dangerous substances from blood.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Liver Cancer interrupts the normal functioning of the liver due to the growth of abnormal cells. Also worth noting is that a large portion of Liver Cancer deaths have been linked to lifestyle factors, something which means that prevention is possible many people.
