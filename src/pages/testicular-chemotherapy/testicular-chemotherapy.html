    Unfortunately, many of the procedures that are currently feasable for treating Testicular Cancers have been known to produce uncomfortable side effects. Perhaps the most common of these treatments is chemotherapy, which is used to great effect in many to subdue tumors that have spread beyond the point of origin.

     Scientists are hard at work to modify these treatments to produce fewer side effects. By mixing and matching various drug combinations, doctors can minimize the amount of adverse effects that the patient is exposed to, and in doing so are able to ensure that nobody is under or over treated.

    <p class = "whiten">
 Such experiments have been reported to reduce the side effects without compromising on the results produced by the treatment. It is hoped that further research and development in this respect will make these life-saving treatments more comfortable to endure.
