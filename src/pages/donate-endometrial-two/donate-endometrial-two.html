 The Mary Kay Foundation is an organization founded in memoriam of Mary Kay, a cancer patient who died Thankgiving day 2001, and her dream to further cancer research to the benefit of patients all around the world.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
This foundation is not specific to Endometrial Cancers, instead seeking to confront all cancers that afflict women. This includes, but is not limited to, diseases such as Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
The mission statement of the Mary Kay foundation is a simple one: to continuously provide support for top medical facilities in order to help fund research that leads to the eradication of cancer afflicting women while also ending the disease of domestic violence all around the world by providing shelters and local outreach programs.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They have been tremendously successful in both respects, and have to date awarded over 17.3 million dollars to top cancer researchers around the globe. People like you are the ones who keep foundations such as this running. Because of the continued support of generous individuals, these foundations are able to keep up their work and slowly destroy a disease that plagues women around the world.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Take a simple step forward today, and contribute to the battle against Endometrial Cancer and diseases like it through The Mary Kay Foundation.
