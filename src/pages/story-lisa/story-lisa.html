    <p class = "answer special-answer">Some of the names in this interview may have been changed to protect the identity of those involved.</p>
    <p class = "question">When and how did you first find out you had cancer?</p>
    
    <p class = "answer">
     I had just graduated from law school and was three weeks into studying for the California Bar when I started experience chest pain. Everyone thought that I was anxious about studying for the bar — I didn’t even want to see the doctor, I had to study — but my primary care physician ended up scheduling an appointment for me so I went in. 
    </p> 

    <p class = "answer">
      They did a chest x-ray, and the radiologist actually read the x-ray as normal, but my physician (and my dad who is also a physician) thought something was off and decided I should go to the ER. I went to the ER and that night an ER doctor told me I had an 11cm mass in my chest. My first reaction was “But I have to study for the bar!” 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    A few months into my treatment my husband was diagnosed with Metastatic Papillary Thyroid cancer, which he is still in treatment for. Actually, the best part of this story is that it all happened because I lent hair clippers to the woman who lived down stairs from us and she cut her 1 year-old sons hair. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
   The little boy’s haircut was so bad, SO BAD. I didn’t laugh in her face but I laughed the rest of the night which they believe ended up creating a tear the aforementioned mass and it bleed into itself and finally caused me symptoms. I was staged with Stage 3a Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin’s lymphoma – bulky type. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How has having cancer influenced your relationships with friends and family members?</p>

    <p class = "answer">
    It is hard to describe how having cancer has influenced my relationship with friends and family because it has changed each relationship differently. It has brought my husband and I closer since we both received our cancer diagnosis at similar times. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    It has also made my family closer in general because we moved back in with my parents for support. A lot of friends were tremendously helpful and provided me with so much support. Having cancer definitely made me realize how much my friends and family love and care for me. Everything hasn’t been rosy though. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Some people had a difficult time reaching out or knowing what to say once they heard about my diagnosis. People have different ways of dealing with traumatic situations. I try to remind myself that not everyone deals with things the same when I find myself letting cancer effect my relationships. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How did your family members cope with the situation?</p>
    <p class = "answer">
    Each of my family members (immediate and extended) coped with my diagnosis in their own way. Everyone was very supportive but people deal with their emotions differently. 

    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
Some family members were very open and honest with their emotions and some would bottle them up or sometimes appear distant. I think overall my family was incredibly supportive and coped with the situation really well but at the same time, there will always be good days and bad days when dealing with the situation is easier or harder. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I think looking back that everyone coped in the best way they could or what felt most comfortable to them. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How have you coped with the situation?</p>
    
    <p class = "answer">
      At first, after I was diagnosed I was completely devastated and I cried a lot. I leaned very heavily on my family and friends. The first few months were really difficult because you feel very alone. I still have bad days, but the good days far out number them. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    It helped to get into touch with other cancer patients who I could share my thoughts and fears with. Talking with other cancer patients helped me recognize my feelings and made me feel less alone. Plus you can say things to them that you can’t say to anyone else. That being said I think one of the important things that I realized is that coping is a process. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I’ve come to the conclusion that I am never really “done” coping and that the fear will always be there—it is how I deal with the fear on a daily basis that will define how I move forward. 
    
    </p>
    <p class = "answer">
      I came to the conclusion that cancer will be a part of my life no matter what happens from here on out, and while I don’t have to enjoy the fear, I have to accept it and try and live my life in a way that has meaning for myself and those around me.
