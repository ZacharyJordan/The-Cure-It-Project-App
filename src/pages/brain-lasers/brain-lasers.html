  One of the most valuable ways to approach an issue as large as Brain Cancer is to experiement with what may seem like crazy ideas. That's exactly what Dr. Ricardo Komotar, chair of the Florida Neurosurgical Society did with his Visualase Thermal Therapy System, a laser based therapy designed to treat advanced forms of Brain Cancer with minimal side effects.

  While current applications of the treatment have been limited, the leap in technology is impressive. It utilizes a 3-millimeter laser probe to seek out and essentially cook the cancerous tumor from the inside out without harming healthy brain tissue.

The technology as it currently exists is meant for those with Brain Cancers that have advanced to the stage of being considered inoperable or beyond the control of traditional treatments.

  It is technology such as this that must be explored further in order to advance the fight against Brain Cancers. As Komotar himself puts it, "This game-changing technology provides hope for brain cancer patients who otherwise have no treatment options".
