    Whether or not the severity of the Laryngeal Cancer is high or low, treatment by Laryngectomy requires some form on removal of the larynx. The purpose of any Laryngectomy is the same: to remove the entire cancer while leaving behind as much of the larynx as possible.

     So, some people will undergo a partial Laryngectomy where the top part of one’s Larynx is removed along with the cancer cells. Patients can still speak following this surgery. However, a full Laryngectomy requires the total removal of the larynx, preventing one from being able to speak using vocal chords.

  However, the ability to speak is not completely lost. Nowadays, the most common method of restoring speech is done through Tracheo-esophageal puncture (TEP). This method requires a small hole to be punctured through one’s throat order to allow air to be passed from the lung to the mouth, resulting in sustained speech.
