They have been honored with a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, something which ensures that all funds are allocated in a responsible manner that is consistant with the goal of eliminating the threat of Breast Cancer. In fact, over 80 percent of their total revenue is directed to valuable programs that have saved countless lives.
