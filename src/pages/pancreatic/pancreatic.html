      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
    Pancreatic Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases currently operating in the world today. While it is relatively rare compared to other forms of cancer, the prognosis can often be quite dire for those that suffer from it.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      This unfortunate fact can even hold true in cases in which the cancer is diagnosed and treated early in its development, although such a situation can benefit the outlook of the disease when compared to its later stages.
      </p>
        
        <p class = "whiten">
      There are two major types of Pancreatic Cancer: Exocrine Tumors and Endocrine Tumors. Both types will be discussed thoroughly below.

      <p class = "whiten">
       The graph below reveals the prominence of the 2 different types of Pancreatic Cancers relative to each other. The clear leader is Exocrine Tumors, with Endocrine Tumors coving a tiny fraction of total Pancreatic Cancer cases.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Exocrine Tumors are easily the most common form of Pancreatic Cancers. Because of this, a diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer is almost always referring to this specific type of tumor.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        Formulating a working knowledge of the differences between Exocrine and Endocrine Tumors is important due to the differences in prognosis and methods of treatment that each subset of the disease demands.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      ndocrine Tumors occur significantly less than Exocrine Tumors largely because only about 5% of the cells in the pancreas are Enteroendocrine (Endocrine) Cells.
      </p>
        
        <p class = "whiten">
        While Exocrine Tumors are known for spreading to other systems in the body, Endocrine Tumors are typically only able to spread within the pancreas itself, thus limiting the mortality rate of this disease significantly.

      External Beam Radiation Therapy is a subset of radiation therapy that is employed to reduce the size of or remove certain tumors. It is used in cancers of the pancreas due to the targeted nature of the treatment.

        The Lustgarten Foundation is an organization that has tirelessly dedicated itself to the eradication of Pancreatic Cancers. They pursue this goal on 2 equally important fronts: increasing public awareness of the issue of Pancreatic Cancer and what the average person can do to help, and working to ensure that proper funding is allocated to the research and development of effective new treatments that are specific to the disease.

     The foundation maintains a high degree of intellectual credibility by establishing a strict set of guidelines that dictate the standards that must be met to receive their recognition.

   To date, The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network has provided over 28 million dollars to such institutions, and in doing so has saved and improved thousands of lives. Their mission extends beyond patient services to take care of the families of those affected by Pancreatic Cancer.
