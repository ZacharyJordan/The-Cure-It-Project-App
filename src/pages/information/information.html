    Why did you make this app?
  </ion-card-header>
  <ion-card-content>
    We created The Cure It Project after having difficulty finding simple, clear information about a certain type of cancer. While the current body of cancer
    information is broad, it can often be difficult to approach without some background in medicine. We hope our application fixes this problem.
