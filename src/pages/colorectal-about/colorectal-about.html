  Colorectal Cancers are cancers that start in either the colon or rectum. They are often grouped together due to the similarities that they share with one another. There are several different types of Colorectal Cancers, each with their own properties that warrant individualized attention. The three that we will be taking a look at are Adenocarcinomas, Sarcomas, and Carcinoid tumors.

    Colorectal Cancers are often very preventable due to the relatively predictable way in which they develop. The vast majority of Colorectal Cancers begin as a polyp, which typically begin developing in the inner lining of the colon or rectum.

    <p class = "whiten">
 Some (but not all) of these polyps will develop into Colorectal Cancer if left untreated. This means that one of the best ways to prevent Colorectal Cancers is to remove these polyps early.

 Recent advancements in technology have brought with them an enhanced understanding of how to do this, something which has been useful in somewhat quelling the threat of Colorectal Cancers.
