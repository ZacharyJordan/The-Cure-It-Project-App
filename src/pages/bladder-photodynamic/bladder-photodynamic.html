     Recent years have yielded advances in treatment of Bladder Cancer. One of the most promising is the application of photodynamic therapy. This practice involves injecting small, light-sensitive chemicals into the bloodstream of a patient.
</p>
   
<p class = "whiten">
  These chemicals accrue along the lining of the bladder and “stick” to cancerous cells. Then, physicians can fire high-intensity light at the PDT chemicals, causing them to morph into a new chemical that is toxic to cancer cells. This technique is effective at killing cancer cells along the lining of the bladder wall, but often times will miss deeper tumors entirely.

  A recent study conducted by the University of San Diego examines how advances in photodynamic therapy have developed over the past decade. While concluding that PDT is an effective treatment that will soon be viable for mass use, it notes that the field does have a ways to go before it can be considered above more conventional treatments like chemotherapy.

It cites the inability for PDT compounds to penetrate necrotic tissue (dead cells that serve as a breeding ground for disease) and the expensive nature of creating these chemicals as the two major drawbacks to this therapy. 
</p>

  Fortunately, most Bladder Cancer patients - Stages I, II, and III - will not experience tissue necrosis and will not forgo PDT on that basis. Additionally, as the field continues to progress, we will see a decrease in the cost of synthesizing PDT compounds as more research is conducted and the process is more widely used.
