 The Foundation for Women's Cancer is an organization that has been tirelessly working to combat cancer in females since its inception in 1991. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They attempt to reach this goal on three different fronts: raising public awareness, providing education, and supporting research for top institutions around the world. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Their work would go unfulfilled without the continuous support provided by people like you. The foundation has to date funded 2.5 million dollars in research, and the recipients were able to return nearly 58 million dollars in the form of extramural research funding.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
That is a 23-fold return on investment. This kind of astonishing growth can only continue with the support of you.
    </p>
