   Because Ovarian Cancer is so difficult to detect, grasping an increased understanding of what causes the disease the first place is all but a necessity. This allows scientists and doctors alike to develop a new standard under which to operate when approaching Ovarian Cancer treatment.

    <p class = "whiten">
     Recent research has revealed the effect that certain gene mutations have on the risk of developing Ovarian Cancer, and such information is being used to develop mathematical models to estimate how much a particular women would benefit from undergoing surgery to prevent Ovarian Cancer. This affords women the ability to make proactive choices that lead to a reduction in their personal risk for contracting Ovarian Cancer.

 Progress has also been made on the front of furthering out understanding of Ovarian Cancer's risk factors. One such factor is the failure to employ oral contraceptives. In fact, women who used oral contraceptives for 5 years or more have historically seen a 50 percent reduction in the probability of contracting Ovarian Cancer.

     <p class = "whiten">
It is through the promotion of discoveries such as this that people everywhere can grasp a complete understanding of how to prevent Ovarian Cancer in the first place, something which will do much to reduce its influence overall.
