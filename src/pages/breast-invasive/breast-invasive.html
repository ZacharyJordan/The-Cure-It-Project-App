   Determining whether the Breast Cancer is invasive or not is an essential step in terms of establishing a healthy, effective treatement plan on an individual level. The vast majority of Breast Cancers are invasive - about 79 percent, in fact - meaning that the cancer develops into areas that used to be composed of normal, healthy tissue.

    <p class = "whiten">
   Invasive Breast cancer is classified by the cancer cells spreading beyond the established membranes to invade surrounding tissues. Once the cancer has advanced to this stage, it then becomes much easier for it to spread around other parts of the body, thus compromising the health of the patient.

 Think of the membrane as a suit of armor - once this protective shell has been breached, the situation suddenly becomes a lot more dangerous. If the cancer is invasive, it can be classified as being between Stages I and Stage IV. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Non-invasive Breast Cancers are classified when the cancer has not spread beyond the membrane typically associated with milk ducts in the breast. These types of cancer are considered to be Stage 0 of the disease.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
      Although the situation involving non-invasive Breast Cancers is far less dangerous, lack of immediate treatement can sometimes mean that the disease will spread into surrounding tissues. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
      Also worth noting is that it is possible for a Breast Cancer to be simutaniously invasive and non-invasive. This happens when part of the cancer has grown into healty tissue while the other part of the cancer remains behind in milk ducts or other related areas. Situations such as these warrant the same type of treatement as invasive Breast Cancer.
