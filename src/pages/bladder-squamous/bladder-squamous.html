     Squamous cells are specialized cells that line the vital internal organs of the body. Similarly to transitional cells, squamous cells regularly come into contact with the body's waste and are exposed to a whole host of toxins as a result.
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
When infected, they die quickly, so they are less prone to growing out of control and becoming cancerous than transitional cells. Squamous cells are identified by their spongy nature and flat, rectangular shape.

<p class = "whiten">
  They are found in the lining of the bladder in conjunction with transitional cells, and can be infected by cancer easily as a result. Most common in parts of the world with high levels of schistosomiasis, a disease caused by worm infections, squamous cell Bladder Cancer amounts to about 5% of diagnosed cases.

<p class = "whiten">
Although there is no substitute for a properly administered medical exam, there are telltale signs of having cancer. These include bone pains, bladder distention, and foot/ankle/joint swelling, but the primary identifiers are related to problems with urination.

<p class = "whiten">
The inability to pass urine is often indicative of the presence of a tumor. Moreover, any blood present in urine is also a cause for concern, whether or not pain is experienced. Often times the problem occurs only intermittently. Encountering any of these symptoms for excessive periods of time is grounds for a conversation with your doctor.
