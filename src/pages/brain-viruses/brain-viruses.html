   The use of antiviral drugs has been a treatment method that has bore some success in recent years. For instance, a 2006 clinical trial conducted by Dr. Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler made use of Valcyte - an antiviral drug usually used to treat viruses in AIDS patients - to combat some of the more aggressive forms of Brain Cancer.

   The results were shocking, with 70 percent more patients surviving past the two year mark. In fact, the average survival rate for patients recieving this antiviral treatment was three years higher than those only exposed to traditional treatement measures.

After recieving this innovative treatment, one of the patients went so far as to remark, "I know I am alive today because of Dr. Cobbs."

    While the results in this trial are not reason enough to entirely alter current treatment plans, their encouraging findings suggest that the general trends that dictate Brain Cancer research are positive on balance. As Dr. David Reardon, director of neuro-oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute puts it, "[This is] very exciting data."
