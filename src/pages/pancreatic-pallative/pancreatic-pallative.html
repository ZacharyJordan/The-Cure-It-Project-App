    Palliative Surgery is less of a treament method and more of a way of managing pain so that other treatment methods may be employed. That said, recent medical advancements have increased the effectiveness of this option and in doing so have supported the comfort and happiness of thousands of patients around the globe. It typically involves the removal of an intestinal obstruction or other masses that are causing pain or disfigurement in the patient.
