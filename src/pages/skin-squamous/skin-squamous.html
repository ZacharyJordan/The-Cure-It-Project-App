    Squamous Cell Carcinoma is a form of Skin Cancer in which abnormal cells begin arising in the skin's upper layers. They are the second most common form of Skin Cancer, accounting for nearly 20 percent of all non-Melanoma Skin Cancers.

     They are relatively easy to detect due to the scaly red patches and open sores that the disease often creates. This, in combination with the slow-moving nature of the cancer, means that less than 1 percent of all those afflicted will eventually die as a result of their disease.
