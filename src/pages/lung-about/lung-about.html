     Lung Cancers are, in their most basic form, tumorous growths located in the lungs. Their influence can involve anything from taking over the membrane of the lung to disrupting air holes inside the lung. The impact of Lung Cancer is tremendous, with the disease claiming 27% of all cancer deaths combined. This makes it the leading cancer in terms of mortality.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      Despite the seriousness of Lung Cancer, early location of the disease can go a long way in terms of making sure that it does not become life threatening. There are three primary types of Lung Cancer: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (also called NSC Lung Cancer), Small Cell Lung Cancer (also called SC Lung Cancer), and Lung Carcinoids.

  The lungs are one of the most important organs in the body. They are responsible for processing air as well as providing a place for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. When you breathe, air goes through your nose and down your windpipe into your lungs. From here, it spreads through tubes called Bronchi.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
The majority of Lung Cancers begin in the cells that line these tubes. To put it simply, Lung Cancer hinders typical lung functioning, something which effectively disrupts the patient's ability to process oxygen and maintain a healthy blood compositon as they normally would.

While a reliable method of identifying the cause of Lung Cancer has yet to be discovered, there are some factors that influence a particular individual's chances of contracting the disease. The most important of these factors is the use of cigarettes or other carcinogenic inhalents.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
In fact, cigarette smoking has been linked to nearly 90% of all Lung Cancer cases. This knowledge means that people everywhere have a way to actively combat Lung Cancer through avoiding harmful substances such as these.
