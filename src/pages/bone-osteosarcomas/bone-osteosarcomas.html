    Osteosarcoma is the most frequent form of Bone Cancer. Before discussing how this form of cancer impacts patients, it is first essential to understand the implications of the cancer's location in the skeletal system.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      The role of the skeletal system in the body is essential, as it provides for protection and support for a wide variety of bodily functions. The only reason why the body is able to move the way it is is due to the joints and bones located all over the body, something that this form of cancer inhibits. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   The fact that bones are located virtually everywhere on the body is precisely what makes it so dangerous. Osteosarcomas can technically occur anywhere that a bone exists, but they most commonly form near the lower thigh, shin bone, and the upper arm (sometimes referred to as the Femur, Tibia, and Humerus respectively).
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    The exact causes of this form of cancer are unknown, but it is suspected that genetics play a key factor in the transmission of the diseaes. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    The danger of Osteosarcomas, like most form of cancer, are highly contingent on the stage in which they were discovered. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    For instance, if the cancer is discovered before it metastasizes, the 5 year survival rate for patients is generally noted to fall anywhere from 60 to 80 percent. However, if the cancer spreads before it is found, the survival rate within this same timeframe can be as low as 15 to 30 percent. 

    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
   Symptoms of Osteosarcomas vary from patient to patient, but there are a few common ones to be noted. These include intense pain at the tumor site, rare bone fractures, difficulty with breathing, and sudden weight loss without explanation.
