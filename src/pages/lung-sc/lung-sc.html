    Small Cell Lung Cancer (also called SC Lung Cancer for short) is different from NSC Lung Cancer in a few different ways. As is apparent from the name, the actual size of the cancerous cells are much smaller in size, and typically require sophisticated scientific instruments to examine properly.

    <p class = "whiten">
     While NSC Lung Cancer starts in the bronchioles, SC Lung Cancer almost always originates in the bronchi. Because the bronchi are the key pipes that lead into your lungs, the cancer is able to quickly spread throughout the body when compared with NSC Lung Cancer.

    <p class = "whiten">
SC Lung Cancer has been described as the most aggressive form of Lung Cancer due to its tendancy to rapidly spread throughout the body. This description is reflective of the survival rates that patients who contract the disease face. In fact, only 31% of those lucky enough to discover the disease in stage I survive beyond 5 years.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
Representing the worst case scenario, 2% of stage IV patients achieve the same success. While the issue is grave, some comfort can be taken in the fact that every case is different, and factors such as overall health and the type of treatment recieved can go a long way in terms of maximizing survival chances.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
SC Lung Cancer is relatively rare, accounting for just 10% of total Lung Cancer cases. While its exact cause is difficult to pinpoint, it is known that the majority of cases have been closely associated with the consumption of tobacco.
