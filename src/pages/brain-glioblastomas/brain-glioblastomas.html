    Glioblastomas are cancerous tumors made up from the supportive tissue of the brain. They are highly dangerous due to their rapid rate of reproduction and their tendancy to invade other portions of the brain before action can be taken. In fact, around 13,000 people die of these brain tumors each and every year in the United States alone.

    The symptoms of Glioblastomas may on the surface seem fairly similar to those of Meningiomas. They include: memory loss, nausea, headaches, and alterations in personality. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 However, because the cancerous cells come from normal brain cells, it is easy for them to invade healthy brain tissue. This accelerates the timetable of the cancer, making it easier to discover while also making it more dangerous to contract. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    Over 90 percent of Glioblastomas fall within the category of Primary Brain Cancers. These form very quickly and are very agressive, leading to symptoms that at times can seem crippling.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    This combined with the fairly common nature of this type of Brain Cancer may explain why the majority of people who contract Primary Brain Cancer do not even survive their first year of being sick.
