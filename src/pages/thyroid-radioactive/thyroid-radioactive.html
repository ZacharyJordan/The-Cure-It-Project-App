    Radioactive Iodine is one of the most exciting new developments in the field of Thyroid Cancer research. They exist as a relative noninvasive means to treat particularly advanced cases of Thyroid Cancer, and can even be used in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond its point of origin.

     Thyroid cells are one of the few cells in the body that possess the mechanisms to properly absorb and concentrate Iodine. Medical professionals take advantage of this fact by inserting radioactive iodine into the bloodstream of the patient.

    <p class = "whiten">
 After the Iodine is absorbed by the cancerous thyroid cells, the radiation that was implanted into the Iodine essentially destroys the cancerous cells from the inside.

 Because Thyroid cells are the only kind that latch onto the Iodine, the rest of the body remains relatively safe from the radiation. Treatments of this nature mark a stark break from the ways of the past, as doctors and patients alike are able to achieve effective treatment without many of the negative side effects that are typically associated with cancer treatment.
