     This is a field that has, even in just the past two years, exploded with activity. These types of improvements allow doctors to "teach" a patient's cells to seek out and destroy cancerous cells.

    <p class = "whiten">
      This can act as a welcome supplement to more aggressive forms of treatment, as it provides another avenue upon which cancer can be attacked, thus resulting in the long term safety and security of patients that may have struggled in the past.

   A 2014 study titled Efficacy and Toxicity Management if 19-28z CAR T Cell Therapy in B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia unveiled some of the improvments that have been made in this field over the past few years.

    The study built on information gathered in the original 2013 analysis and experimented with innovative new methods of treatment, taking care to specifically discover and detail alternatives to stem cell transplants. Their findings were incredibly encouraging, with 88 percent of the involved patients responding positively to the treatment.

    All of the most common side effects, while unpleasant, were ultimately completely treatable and did not affect the patients in the long term.

   Additionally, a study titled Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells for Sustained Remissions in Leukemia attempted to reprogram blood cells to seek out and destroy cancerous cells before infusing back into the general bloodstream. The treatment led to complete remissions in 90 percent of the patients involved.

      All of these patients had failed to respond to conventional treatments, and some had relapsed several times before. This treatment, for many of the patients, was the only source of hope that they had encountered in years. While unintended side effects hampered some patients, the scientists remain optimistic that these early difficulties can and will be resolved.

      In fact, lead researcher Carl June suggests that the versatile methods used in the study could prove valuable in treating other forms of cancer, such as cancer of the pancreas or lungs.
