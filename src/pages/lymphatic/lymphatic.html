      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
    Lymphoma is classified as the uncontrollable growth of a specific type of white blood cell called a lymphatic cell. It is a variant of Blood Cancer, but possesses enough unique properties to warrant individual analysis.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      There are 2 main types of Lymphatic Cancers: Hodgkin's Disease, and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The specifics of both of these will be dissected in great detail down below.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       As can be seen through the chart below, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (sometimes referred to as NHL) is far more common than Hodgkin's Disease. In fact, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is the 6th most prominent form of cancer in men.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is the most common form of Lymphatic Cancers, with around 8 cases documented for every one cases of Hodgkin's Disease. It is the 6th most common form of cancer in men, and the 5th most common cancer in women, thus posing a serious threat to everybody.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        Perhaps the most troubling fact is that the prominence of this disease has been persistently growing since the early 1970's, with an 83 percent increase being observed in the quarter-century following 1973.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      Hodgkin's Disease (sometimes referred to as HD) attacks the same area that Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma does: the lymphocytes. Hodgkin's Disease takes over these cells, and in doing so weakens the immune system.
      </p>
        
        <p class = "whiten">
        This has the adverse effect of making the body more prone to sickness. Because of this, the symptoms of Hodgkin's Disease are very similar to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

       In its most basic form, immunotherapy is the practice of applying the immune system to combat the development and spread of cancerous cells.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
   While such therapies have existed for some time now, recent developments have made this form of treatment significantly more effective and comfortable for the patient when applied against Lymphatic Cancers.
