      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
     Bone Cancer is described as the uncontrollable growth of cells that originates in areas with bones or bone related cells. Bone Cancer is one of the more frightening forms of cancer due to the ease with which it can spread.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      There are 3 primary types of Bone Cancers: Osteosarcomas, Ewing Tumors (ET), and Chondrosarcomas. All of these will be discussed in great detail. 
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       As shown through the graph below, Osteosarcomas are easily the most common types of Bone Cancer, accounting for 56% of all Bone Cancer cases. This is followed by Ewing Tumors, and finally, Chondrosarcomas.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        As illustrated by the chart above, Osteosarcoma is the most frequent form of Bone Cancer. Before discussing how this form of cancer impacts patients, it is first essential to understand the implications of the cancer's location in the skeletal system.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        The role of the skeletal system in the body is essential, as it provides for protection and support for a wide variety of bodily functions.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      Ewing Tumors are relatively uncommon, accounting for just 34 percent of all Bone Cancer cases. They usually form in the same spots as Osteosarcomas, but there are a few noteable exceptions to this generalization.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       That is, they have been known to form in the cavities of the leg and arm bones, and can also form in soft tissues of the body near bones.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       Chondrosarcomas are different from other forms of Bone Cancer in one very specific way. Instead of infecting hard bones, Chondrosarcomas actually attack the cartilage in the body. They are still capable of forming in the hips, ribs, and arm bones, but the key difference is that they can attack places with cartilage. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
     The symptoms of Chondrosarcomas often make it difficult to detect. In fact, those who contract Chondrosarcoma typically do not feel sick.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       One of the most exciting developments in the field of Bone Cancer treatment has presented itself in the form of Proton Therapy. Proton Therapy offers an alternative to complete surgery, and is especially useful in cases where the bone in question cannot be moved or shifted without harming the patient. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
    Proton Therapy works by targeting certain forms of Bone Cancer with a beam of protons. This high degree of precision allows doctors to deliver radiation to tumors without harming nearby healthy tissue.

       Myeloablative Therapy is one of the most interesting treatment innovations that has been refined over the past couple of years. It works by using powerful forms of chemotherapy to attack cancerous cells, especially those that have spread throughout the body.

     While the overbearing nature of the treatment typicaly results in severe side effects, it can prove effective for patients who have exhausted all other options.

        The Bone Cancer Research Trust has been dedicated to stopping the spread of Bone Cancer since its inception in 2006. Their goals are ambitious, with plans to support the research of advanced Bone Cancers, raise awareness about the disease, enhance general knowledge about its influence, and to provide support for patients that already have it.

      <p class = "whiten">
     The Bone Cancer Research Trust has funded 35 peer-reviewed research projects since 2006. The amount of money donated totals Â£1,392,731, which equates to roughly $2,114,792.
