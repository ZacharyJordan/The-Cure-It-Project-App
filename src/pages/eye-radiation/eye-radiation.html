    Radiation therapy makes use of high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. It is a common treatment for many forms of Eye Cancer, but is used most commonly to treat Intraocular Melanoma.

     While radiation can often preserve some vision in the eye, this sometimes may be lost anyway if the radiation damages vital structures near the infected point. One advantage over surgery that this treatment holds is the preservation of the eye structure, something which may result in a better appearance after treatment.

 One of the most exciting developments in Eye Cancer research in recent years has been the refinement of external beam radiation therapy. This treatment focuses proton beams on the cancer.

Protons are the positive parts of ataoms. Unlike x-rays, which release energy both before and after they hit their target, protons cause little damage to tissue as they pass through and then release their energy after traveling a certain distance.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
While current applications of this technology are limited, the hope is that this treatment will allow more radiation to be delivered to the tumor while doing less damage to healthy tissue. This would mark a huge advancement over previous forms of treatment due to a more perfect balance of effectiveness and comfort.
