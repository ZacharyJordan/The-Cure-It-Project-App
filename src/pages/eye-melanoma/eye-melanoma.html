   Before we can properly dicuss Intraocular Melanomas and the impact that they have on people, it's important to first understand exactly what Melanoma is. In short, Melanoma is caused when malignant cells rapidly grow from melanin, a pigment in the skin which is responsible for tanning.

     This explains why there are health restrictions on tanning beds, and why you use sunscream when you go to the beach. Although Melanoma is usually on our side, it can sometimes start growing rapidly in the eye, thus resulting in Intraocular Melanoma.

 Intraocular Melanoma is by far the most common form of Eye Cancer, accounting for over 90% of all Eye Cancers. One of the most important factors in ensuring that Intraocular Melanomas do not become life threatening is achieving early detection and treatment. This is because Eye Cancers have a tendancy to spread to other parts of the body, something which makes the disease much more difficult to treat effectively.

 The symptoms of Intraocular Melanomas can be devestating if left unchecked. They include: blurred vision, dark spots on the iris, a change in the shape of the pupil, and even a permanent change in position of the eye in the eye socket.
