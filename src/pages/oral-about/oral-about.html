     Oral Cancer is a disease in which a group of oral cells begins to divide uncontrollably, resulting in a tumorous mass. The term "Oral Cancer" can refer to cancers of the lips, cheeks, mouth, tounge, throat, as well as related reigons.

Oral Cancers are sometimes difficult to detect due to the relatively unfrightening way in which the symptoms present themselves.

This harm, at least in part, is provided by a lack of understanding for the issue of Oral Cancers. In fact, over 10 percent of the United States population is completely unaware that of the threat of Oral Cancers.
