      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
    Breast Cancer is a disease in which a group of tumorous cells begins developing in the reigons associated with the breast. All Breast Cancers fall into two categories: Invasive or Non-Invasive. 

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
  There do exist other ways of classifying this deadly disease, such as Recurrent and Metastatic Breast Cancers, and establishing a basic understanding of these is important in terms of fully appreciating the conditions that Breast Cancer patients must deal with everyday.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Determining whether the Breast Cancer is invasive or not is an essential step in terms of establishing a healthy, effective treatement plan on an individual level. The vast majority of Breast Cancers are invasive - about 79 percent, in fact - meaning that the cancer develops into areas that used to be composed of normal, healthy tissue. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        Invasive Breast cancer is classified by the cancer cells spreading beyond the established membranes to invade surrounding tissues.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
     At its most basic level, Recurrent Breast Cancer is Breast Cancer that returns after initial treatement. This is often very difficult to detect and eliminate because initial treatements are designed with the intent of eliminating all cancerous cells, meaning that some patients let their guard down after completion. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       There are three primary forms of recurrence: local, regional, and distant. Local and regional recurrence both imply that the cancer has resurfaced at a similar location as the original cancer.

      <span class = "whiten center-title-lower">Metastatic Breast Cancer</span>
      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      Metastatic Breast Cancer is classified when the cancer has spread to other organs in the body. It is sometimes also referred to as stage IV Breast Cancer. It is generally uncommon for Metastatic Breast Cancer to be declared upon an initial diagnosis, as it typically develops after completing treatment for an earlier stage of Breast Cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
   Deaths resulting from Breast Cancer do not come from cancer that remains in the breast. The transportation of dangerous cancer cells to vital positions in the body such as the bones, liver, or brain is what actually threatens life.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
     The last decade of research has done much to emphesize the link between healthy lifestyle choices and a decrease in Breast Cancer occurance. For instance, recent discoveries have uncovered that being overweight increases the risk of contracting Breast Cancer after menopause. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
  This discovery is significant for two reasons: most women reach menopause around the age of 50, and the majority of Breast Cancer cases are seen in women above this age.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
     There exists within nearly 20 percent of Breast Cancer patients an abnormal strain of HER2 proteins. This protein essentially drives up the growth of cancerous cells.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
    While in the past this was something that worsened survival rates, recent research has all but eliminated this additonal risk and in doing so has saved countless lives. As medical oncologist Dr. Wendy Chen puts it, "HER2-directed therapies have revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer."
