    For many women, surgery is the go-to treatment for Endometrial Cancer of any form. The specific type of surgery that is done is called a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy involves removing the uterus as well as any other troublesome satellite structures of the uterus such as the cervix or ovaries.

     While the basic idea behind a hysterectomy has not changed over the past couple of years, advancements in our understanding of how the uterus functions has made the surgery more effective and safe.

 The goal when conducting a hysterectomy is to control the growth of the cancerous cells through the removal of tumors. Thus, the surgery is most effective when treating type I Endometrial Carcinomas, as many of the tumors associated with this form of cancer have yet to spread beyond the place of origin. It is not uncommon for the entire uterus to be removed in order to completely eradicate all cancerous cells from the body.

There has been a massive effort over the past few decades to improve this form of surgery to ensure a higher degree of success. In adherance to this fact, medical facilities all around the world have adopted robotic systems that guide these surgeries, offering up the enhanced precision necessary to save lives.
