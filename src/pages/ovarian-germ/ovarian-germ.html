    Germ Cell Tumors are relatively rare within the context of Ovarian Cancer, accounting for roughly 2 percent of all newly diagnosed cases. They almost always occur in younger women, and can affect those who are still teenagers.

    <p class = "whiten">
     Germ Cell Tumors are usually relatively easy to handle if they are found early and given proper treatment. Unfortunately, the vauge nature of the symptoms makes such a task difficult to say the least.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
There are usually no symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and those that do emerge are things often associated with less severe conditons. Some of these symptoms include the mildly swelling of the abdomen or unusual bleeding.
