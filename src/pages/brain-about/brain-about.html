    <p class = "whiten">
     Brain Cancer is a disease in which a group of cancerous cells begin developing in a person's brain tissue. This can have massive implications on the functioning of typical brain operations such as muscle control, sensation, and memory development.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      All Brain Cancers fall into two primary categories: Primary and Secondary. However, there do exist other classifications of this deadly disease, such as Meningiomas and Glioblastomas.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   The impacts of Brain Cancer are everywhere. Nearly 700,000 people in the United States are currently living with Brain Cancer, with over 191 cases being discovered each and every day worldwide. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   While the threat of Brain Cancer can impact anyone, it is statistically more common in younger children and older adults. In fact, Brain Cancer accounts for 25 percent of all cancers seen in children.

    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   The side effects of Brain Cancer can persist throughout the remainder of a victim's life, thus necessitating further research to eliminate this unecessary threat.
