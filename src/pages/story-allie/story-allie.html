    <p class = "question">When and how did you first find out you had cancer?</p>
    
    <p class = "answer">
     I originally was sick for 4ish months at the end of last year (2014). I didn't have health insurance so I didnt go to the hospital until mid-December. On a normal day I vomited everything I ate and my sense of smell was highened dramatically. I would also wake up covered in sweat to the point of having to change my sheets and pillow cases every morning. 
    </p> 

    <p class = "answer">
    I honestly thought I had the stomach bug that was going around and since I worked with kids I figured I just kept getting it over and over again. After a while the fevers started. At first, they were steady around 101° but then in December it started to spike and when it got to 103° I said screw not having health insurance and went to the hospital. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "answer">
    The doctor came in after tons of blood tests and said "Since you are getting health insurance in a month I suggest you coming back to us then." So on January 12th I went back to the hospital and they admitted me immediately. They ran a lot of tests thinking it was autoimmune since I have Arthritis. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Once those came back negative they did a Bone Marrow biopsy. A oncologist came in and I knew right away I had cancer. He confirmed that I had Hodgkins Lymphoma and did further testing. I was told about two weeks later that I had Stage 4 cancer and it was in my bone marrow. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How has having cancer influenced your relationships with friends and family members?</p>

    <p class = "answer">
      They say that hardship brings your friends closer and shows you who is really important in your life. I've learned how strong my bonds were with my friends through this journey. My friends were some of the biggest support system I have. My family is really supportive but they had a harder time with my diagnosis than I did so I couldn't really talk to them about it. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    My boyfriend and I were only together for around 6 months when I was diagnosed and he has been the biggest help through this all. He stayed with me in the hospital everytime I had to go and he helped me overcome my fear of being in public while bald. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Side story to show you how amazing my friends are: I've had my horse for 5 years now and when I got really sick I couldn't work. Since I couldn't take care of him I gave him away to an older couple with grandkids and cut off all communication with my horse friends. I couldn't stand to be around horses and horse people knowing my boy was out there away from me. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Two of my horse friends found out I was diagnosed with cancer and they got him back for me and surprised me with him. They have land about 30 minutes away from me and they are keeping him free of charge until I'm able to work again. They have completely taken over the care, vet bills and feed bills for him. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How have you coped with your situation?</p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Humor has been the only to make this a bit easier on me. It might not be appropriate but I crack chemo jokes to people. Everyone has had an aunt or cousin who has had cancer but not many people had direct contact with us "cancer folks." 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
Most people don't know how to handle the situation or know what to say. Laughing is something everyone knows thankfully! If you can find humor in the situation then so can everyone else. They don't feel as sorry for you and start treating you like a normal person. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">Do you think that public awareness is where it needs to be for cancer in general?</p>
    
    <p class = "answer">
    I definitely don't think it's where it needs be at all. It seems like people are aware of lung cancer, due to all the smoking commercials, leukemia or breast cancer. When I started telling people I had Stage 4B Hodgkins Lymphoma just about everyone asked me how long I have left. Talk about scary! We need to be more aware of the different types of cancer out there. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">How about specific types of cancers</p>
    <p class = "answer">
    Blood cancer seems to be less known but just as prominent as breast cancer (from my understanding.) Lymphoma affects the young and the elderly so we need to have the symptoms more well known to the public.
