    Accounting for just 5% of total cases, Lung Carcinoids are by far the least common form of Lung Cancer. Lung Carcinoids are different from the two other types of Lung Cancer in that they typically don't affect the physical pathways of the lungs, but rather special types of cells called nueroendocrine cells that produce hormones such as adrenaline in order to regulate and control the energy levels of lung cells.

     Lung Carcinoids also vary from NSC and SC Lung Cancers in terms of their rate of growth. Lung Carcinoids develop extremely slowly when compared to other types of Lung Cancers.

 The reason for this is because the other two types utilize the circulatory system to carry cancer cells, and blood moves very rapidly throughout the body. Carcinoids take longer because they mimic the movement of hormones, which are inherently slower than the blood transportation system.

    <p class = "whiten">
 This means that the 5-year survival rates that Lung Carcinoid patients experience is very positive when compared to other forms of lung cancer. In fact, 93 percent of patients whose cancer is discovered in stage I survive 5 years or more.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
 Additionally, the slow development rate of Lung Carcinomas means that patients sometimes go relatively long periods of time without the cancer worsening significantly, thus affording them additional leniency in discovering the disease before it becomes life threatening.
