  The Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation is a nonprofit that strives to heighten the general public's awareness of the threat of Testicular Cancers.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
In order to make this happen, they recognize that the important first step is to tear down the stigma and unnecessary unembarrassment that is associated with a Testicular Cancer diagnosis. Their goal is to create a society that is more welcoming of open and honest conversations regarding Testicular Cancer that are free from the fear of judgement. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
One of the most impactful ways in which they compel people to take action is through sharing images of Testicular Cancer survivors and victims. By providing a sense of community, the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation is effective in combating the lonliness and isolation that sometimes surrounds cancer diagnoses.
