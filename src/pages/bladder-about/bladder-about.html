    <p class = "whiten">
      Bladder Cancer is one of the most common types of urinary cancers. In 2014, there were approximately 75,000 diagnoses of Bladder Cancer. 
      There were around 3% of all cancer related fatalities in that year. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      Unfortunately, the number of diagnoses has increased by nearly a quarter over the last decade. 
      This is largely due to the increase in the quality of medical equipment used to perform biopsies and 
      find cancer in the first place, as well as environmental carcinogens.

    <p class = "whiten">
    Bladder Cancer is three to four times more common in men than women and is most common in middle and old age. 
    Thankfully, Bladder Cancer typically responds well to treatment, so early diagnoses usually result in remission.

    That being said, failure to discover this disease in a timely manner can be dangerous, and Stage III and IV Bladder Cancer 
    is often terminal.

    <p class = "whiten">
    Similar to most types of cancer, the diagnosis rate has been steadily increasing over the past few years, while 
    fatalities decrease. As for some relevant statistics: 90% of Bladder Cancer patients are diagnosed above the age 
    of 55, with the average age being around 73 years old.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
    Men are more likely to develop Bladder Cancer than women; 
    men have a roughly 1 in 26 chance while women have a 1 in 90.
