     Follicular Carcinomas are a relatively rare subset of Thyroid Cancer, accounting for just 17% of total cases. They share many similarities with Papillary Carcinomas, and as such are often described as being a specific varient of that form of Thyroid Cancer.

     Both spread relatively easily, and both oiginate within the thyroid. However, there are a few differences that set it apart from other varients of Thyroid Cancer.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
  The prognosis for victims of this disease, while a little more severe than similar cases of Papillary Carcinomas, is still good when considered on balance. In fact, 8 out of 10 people diagnosed with a Follicular Carcinoma survive at least 10 years after their cancer is first identified. Even in extreme cases, when the cancer is discovered in its fourth stage, about half of patients survive 5 years or more. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   Another key difference between the two is that Follicular Carcinomas rarely spread to the lymph nodes. While treatment is still a long way from being comfortable, this allows doctors to pursue less invasive surgical procedures.
