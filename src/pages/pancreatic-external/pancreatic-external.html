   External Beam Radiation Therapy is a subset of radiation therapy that is employed to reduce the size of or remove certain tumors. It is used in cancers of the pancreas due to the targeted nature of the treatment. Recent advancements in medical technologies have done much to reduce the negative side efects of such treatments while also bolstering their effectiveness.

     Treatments such as this are revolutionary due to the relative lack of intrusion that they impress upon the patient in order to get a meaningful result.

 External Beam Radiation Therapy is all but painless and never involves placing radioactive materials inside the patient's body. This makes the therapy a terrific option for those who wish to achieve effective treament without having to endure a painful medical procedure.

External Beam Radiation Therapy is also useful in cases when the cancer has spread from the pancreas to other parts of the body. In these cases, the therapy is typically employed to halt the advance of the cancer rather than remove it completely, a role for which it is almost uniquely suited to be successful.
