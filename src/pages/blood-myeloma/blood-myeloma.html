    Myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow. Individuals with this disease suffer from a disorderly production of unhealthy plasma cells that fill up the bone marrow, thus disrupting the production of normal blood cells.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      This, in many cases, leads to an overabundance of plasma cells which damages the bone itself, which results in an excess of pain and potential bone fractures. Myeloma is a fairly common form of blood cancer, as approximately 60,000 people in the United States currently have the disease, with another 20,000 cases being diagnosed each year. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   While the symptoms of Myeloma may be absent at first, they ultimately develop as plasma cells build up. The relatively lengthy period between contracting the disease and becoming disaserously symptomatic is one of the more dangerous aspects of Myeloma, as it means that early diagnosal can often prove to be difficult. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   In adherance to the sometimes difficult nature of identifiying Myeloma, many symptoms of the disease remain dormant until things have progressed to the point of being potentially dangerous. These symptoms can involve bone pain, weakness, diziness, bruising, or excessive confusion.
