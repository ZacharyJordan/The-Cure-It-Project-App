    <p class = "question">When and how did you first find out you had cancer?</p>

    <p class = "answer">
      My diagnosis came in a really roundabout way since almost nobody suspected something as serious as cancer. I'd had a persistent cough from around April 2012 before I was diagnosed; it started as that kind of cough that sometimes lingers after you've had a cold, so I didn't think much of it. 
    </p> 

    <p class = "answer">
      It slowly progressed to where I'd cough until I gagged (also not too unusual), and eventually I was coughing until I threw up. I started googling what the hell could be causing this, and a lot of the results had to do with acid reflux, so I started watching what I ate...didn't help. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I finally caved and saw a pulmonologist in August of 2013 (I didn't have insurance back then, so I didn't want to drop $100 to see a doctor over a little cough), and he surmised it could be acid reflux, allergies, asthma, or postnasal drip, and prescribed a ton of different medications to fight all of the above. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I spent over $1000 on the medication, but was happy to do so because he assured me one of those diagnoses was right and I would be rid of the cough within a few weeks. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Of course it never happened. At one point I even asked him if it could be cancer; he asked me if the x-ray I'd taken a few months back (I cracked my rib from coughing too much) showed anything, and when I told him it was clear, he said it wasn't cancer. I felt silly for asking and didn't bring it up again. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I went to an urgent care clinic a few months later about the vomiting, and they said it was probably food poisoning, but the nurse practitioner ordered blood tests just in case. They showed elevated levels of some enzyme in my liver, so she ordered a retest after a month..and it came back with similar results.
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    After three more months I had it retested, and when she saw the levels had doubled, she strongly advised going to the ER about this, as it may have been indicative of some sort of bone disease. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    While all that was going on, I started developing a pain in my lower back...kinda like when you sleep wrong and you wake up a little sore, only my pain didn't go away as the day went on. I switched my mattress out and tried different chairs at work, and I saw a chiropractor, accupuncturist, and physical therapist, but none of that helped. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Eventually the pain spread to my hip and got so bad I couldn't walk without a cane. When I went to the ER, I mentioned my hip pain, so they took an x-ray of it...and noticed some unusual growth there. So they ordered a hip MRI, bone scan, and CT scan of my torso. This all happened at the end of February 2014. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    The result: stage IV lung cancer (the biggest tumor was the size of my fist) that had spread to my bone (lumbar spine and hip), liver, and brain. Unfortunately it's not curable, and the only treatment they could give me was to lessen the pain and symptoms.
