    Endocrine Tumors occur significantly less than Exocrine Tumors largely because only about 5% of the cells in the pancreas are Enteroendocrine (Endocrine) Cells. While Exocrine Tumors are known for spreading to other systems in the body, Endocrine Tumors are typically only able to spread within the pancreas itself, thus limiting the mortality rate of this disease significantly.

     Another key distinction that can be formed between Endocrine and Exocrine tumors is the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient. Exocrine Cancers, as stated above, can often affect the entire body, resulting in symptoms that encompass traits such as yellow skin and eyes, fluid in the abdomen, extreme weight loss, and dark urine.

Endocrine Cancers, conversely, often involve symptoms that are more related to moods and feelings. This can include things such as irritability, depression, anxiety, and changes in bodily habits.
