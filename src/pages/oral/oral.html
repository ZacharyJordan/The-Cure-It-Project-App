      <p class = "whiten">
   Oral Cancer is a disease in which a group of oral cells begins to divide uncontrollably, resulting in a tumorous mass. The term "Oral Cancer" can refer to cancers of the lips, cheeks, mouth, tounge, throat, as well as related reigons.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      The three that we will be analyzing later in this page are Squamous Cell Carcinomas, Verrucous Carcinomas, and Salivary Gland Carcinomas.

       Below is a chart that details the composition of the various forms of Oral Cancers, something which allows us to isolate the harms of each individual varient and their resulting impacts on society. Worth noting is that about 90 percent of all Oral Cancer cases are diagnosed as being Squamous Cell

       Your throat and parts of your mouth are covered with many flat squamous cells. Contracting Squamous Cell Carcinoma means that some of these cells have become abnormal and are now actively fighting against the body.

      <p class = "whiten">
        Squamous Cell Carcinomas are a relatively pervasive problem, with over 30,000 people being effected by it each year in the United States alone. This means that Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas account for 2.5 percent of all cancer cases in the United States.

      Verrucous Carcinomas are a relatively rare varient of Squamous Cell Carcinomas, accounting for around 5 percent of all oral cavity cancers. It is typically very slow growing, which means that it rarely spreads to other parts of the body.
      </p>

        However, it can become deeply infused with the oral cavity, something which sometimes results in the degredation of the jaw bone or similar features.

       Salivary Gland Carcinomas are classified when abnormal cells begin to disrupt this bodily function. They are relatively uncommon, only accounting for about 3 percent of head and neck tumors.

       Chemotherapy has always served as a valuable tool for doctors and patients alike to combat Oral Cancers.

   Thankfully, recent advancements have brought with them new applications of chemotherapy that are both better suited for targeting cancerous tumors and more comfortable for those that must experience it.
