  The last decade of research has done much to emphesize the link between healthy lifestyle choices and a decrease in Breast Cancer occurance. For instance, recent discoveries have uncovered that being overweight increases the risk of contracting Breast Cancer after menopause.

    <p class = "whiten">
 This discovery is significant for two reasons: most women reach menopause around the age of 50, and the majority of Breast Cancer cases are seen in women above this age. Research such as this gives survivors and those looking to say healthy an active way to control their risk of contracting Breast Cancer in a very significant way.

 The impact of body weight, for instance, is tremendous: people who are overweight or obese have a 30 to 60 percent higher risk of contracting postmenopausal Breast Cancer when compared to those who maintain a healthier weight.

As further research continues to clarify this link, one can hope that additional attention will be drawn to importance of staying healthy in terms of combatting Breast Cancer. After all, the connection is all but certain.

      Consider the words of Dr. Jennifer Litton, who states, "Across the board weight loss and exercise have been shown to improve outcomes, and obesity has been shown to worsen outcomes". Discoveries such as this promote the idea that health initiatives can and should be applied as a valuable tool used to prevent the occurance of Breast Cancer.
