      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
    Brain Cancer is a disease in which a group of cancerous cells begin developing in a person's brain tissue. This can have massive implications on the functioning of typical brain operations such as muscle control, sensation, and memory development.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
  All Brain Cancers fall into two primary categories: Primary and Secondary. However, there do exist other classifications of this deadly disease, such as Meningiomas and Glioblastomas.

      <p class = "whiten">
       Below is a chart that details the estimated survival rates for those diagnosed with Brain Cancer. As you can see, the issue is quite severe, with just over 40 percent of patients surviving the first five years after diagnosal.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Evaluating whether a Brain Cancer is Primary or Secondary is an essential step in terms of developing an effective treatment plan. A Primary Brain Cancer is one that has started either in the brain or in related structures. A Secondary Brain Cancer is one that began in another part of the body, but spread to the brain after a period of development. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        Only about 20 percent of Brain Cancers are primary. This means that while primary brain tumors only account for around 2 percent of all cancer cases in adults, the reach of Brain Cancer indirectly harms thousands more through secondary brain tumors.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      Meningiomas are, simply put, tumors that arise from the coverings of the brain and spinal cord. They typically are found on the outer curve and top of the brain. Meningiomas are fairly common, accounting for nearly a third of all Primary Brain Cancers. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       In order to truly grasp what it is like to live with a Meningioma, one must first consider the symptoms that those suffering from it sometimes experience. While the symptoms vary in relation to the position and size of the tumor in the brain, some common ones include headaches, weakness, and personality changes.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       Glioblastomas are cancerous tumors made up from the supportive tissue of the brain. They are highly dangerous due to their rapid rate of reproduction and their tendancy to invade other portions of the brain before action can be taken.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
    The symptoms of Glioblastomas may on the surface seem fairly similar to those of Meningiomas. They include: memory loss, nausea, headaches, and alterations in personality.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
      The use of antiviral drugs has been a treatment method that has bore some success in recent years. For instance, a 2006 clinical trial conducted by Dr. Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler made use of Valcyte - an antiviral drug usually used to treat viruses in AIDS patients - to combat some of the more aggressive forms of Brain Cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
   The results were shocking, with 70 percent more patients surviving past the two year mark.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       One of the most valuable ways to approach an issue as large as Brain Cancer is to experiement with what may seem like crazy ideas. That's exactly what Dr. Ricardo Komotar, chair of the Florida Neurosurgical Society did with his Visualase Thermal Therapy System, a laser based therapy designed to treat advanced forms of Brain Cancer with minimal side effects. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
     While current applications of the treatment have been limited, the leap in technology is impressive. It utilizes a 3-millimeter laser probe to seek out and essentially cook the cancerous tumor from the inside out without harming healthy brain tissue.
