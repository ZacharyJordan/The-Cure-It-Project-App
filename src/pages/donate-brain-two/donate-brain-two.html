  The National Brain Tumor Society has been searching tirelessly for potential breakthroughs in Brain Cancer research for well over 30 years now. Their goal is simple: to provide hope for those currently afflicted with a form of Brain Cancer while also funding boundry-pushing research to ensure that this issue becomes one of the past. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
As it stands, the National Brain Tumor Society has awarded more than 31 million dollars across 244 top research and care grants. This tremendous achievement is one that has not one that has not only saved lives in the past, but has also put in place valuable care systems that will continue to protect and improve the quality of life well into the future. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Beyond directly funding individual research grants, they have also made a point to collaborate with several of the top authorities in Brain Cancer research in an effort to make the most out of every dollar donated to them. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
All of this has been accomplished while maintaining financial transparency. In compliance with this fact, their financial records are on display for the public to scrutinize in great detail. Simply put, their interests are aligned with those who suffer from Brain Cancers, and as such they seek to take every step possible to end this terrible disease.
