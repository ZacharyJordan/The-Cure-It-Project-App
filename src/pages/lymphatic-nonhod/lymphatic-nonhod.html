    Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is the most common form of Lymphatic Cancers, with around 8 cases documented for every one cases of Hodgkin's Disease. It is the 6th most common form of cancer in men, and the 5th most common cancer in women, thus posing a serious threat to everybody.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Perhaps the most troubling fact is that the prominence of this disease has been persistently growing since the early 1970's, with an 83 percent increase being observed in the quarter-century following 1973.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 Compounding its high prominence rate is the relatively low survival rates that patients who contract the disease experience. In fact, only 63 percent of patients survived more than 5 years after their original diagnosis. The statistics prove to be even more severe for high risk patients, with only 53 percent of such patients surviving beyond this same milestone.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Additional dangers of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma come from the fact that it can spread around the body fairly easily due to its tendancy to take over blood cells and that it is sometimes very difficult to discover early.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     The symptoms of the disease, while relatively noticable, are often mistaken as being something less severe due to their nonspecific nature. They may include: swollen lymph nodes, severe pain in the joints, chest, or abdomen, and whole body fatigue.
