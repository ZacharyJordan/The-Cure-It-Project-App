  Recent discoveries have done much to allow researchers to explore new varients of traditional surgery in their efforts to boost the survival rates of Liver Cancer patients. These surgeries options to individuals who may have none, something that effectively enhancing the comfort and health of those suffering from this disease.

     One such surgery is Laparoscopic Surgery, a practice in which operations are performed far from the location of the tumor through a series of relatively small incisions. This is beneficial because it involves less blood loss, less pain, and a faster recovery after the initial surgery. While it is still considered to be experimental, Laparoscopic Surgery and procedures like it serve as beacons of innovation in the field of Liver Cancer research.

 These surgeries are supplemented by the emerging practice of adjuvant therapies - treatments given immediately after surgery - to boost survival rates for Liver Cancer patients. While the results so far have been inconclusive, many are excited about the future of these drugs.

Radioembolization, for instance, has seen some success in smaller trial groups, although the repetition of this same success in larger trials is necessary to determine it to be an effective solution.
