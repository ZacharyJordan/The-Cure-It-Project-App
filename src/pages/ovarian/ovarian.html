      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
    Ovarian Cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries, found exclusively in females, are responsible for maintaining the health of the reproductve system and ensuring fertility.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      here are several types of Ovarian Cancers that we will cover in detail. These are Common Epithelial Tumors, Germ Cell Tumors, and Stromal Tumors.
      </p>

       Below is a pie graph that details the 5-year survival rate of those that suffer from Ovarian Cancer. As you can see, Ovarian Cancer is incredible aggressive, claiming over half of all people diagnosed within this timeframe.

      <p class = "whiten">
        Common Epithelial Tumors (sometimes called CETs) are the most frequently observed form of Ovarian Cancers, making up around 90 percent of all diagnosed cases.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       There exists several other ways to classify diseases of this nature, the most common of which are through the distinction of Serous and Endometrioid tumors.

      Germ Cell Tumors are relatively rare within the context of Ovarian Cancer, accounting for roughly 2 percent of all newly diagnosed cases. They almost always occur in younger women, and can affect those who are still teenagers.
      </p>
        
        <p class = "whiten">
        Germ Cell Tumors are usually relatively easy to handle if they are found early and given proper treatment.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       Stromal Tumors are an especially rare type of Ovarian Cancer. They develop from the cell tissue that is typically responsible for producing female hormones.
      </p>
        
        <p class = "whiten">
       One of the largest issues with Stromal Tumor treatment is the issue of recurrence, as Stromal Tumors have been known to come back years after substantial remission has occured. This means that patients can rarely consider themselves 'cured', as the threat of the cancer coming back is a persistent one.

       Recent research has done much to provide new options to doctors and patients alike through the development of life-saving drugs.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
  Because Ovarian Cancer is so difficult to detect at an early stage, many scientists have directed their efforts instead to dealing with Ovarian Cancer in its more advanced stages. This allows the sickest of the sick to be met with new treatments that provide them with hope when previously there was none.

        The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund has made it its mission to fight Ovarian Cancer on both preventative and reactionary fronts. They have completely committed themselves over the years to driving innovative research programs that enable scientists to be more proactive in their battle against Ovarian Cancers.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
     The Ovarian Cancer Research Fund has been very progressive in the allocation of funds, awarding 237 grants totaling over 65 million dollars that have changed the way researchers approach Ovarian Cancer treatment. The research projects that they fund have gone on to be published in some of the most prestigious medical journals on the planet, including the New England Journal of Science and the Clinical Cancer Research Journal.

      <p class = "whiten">
   The Coalition has promoted and funded a great number of programs, all of which have advanced the fight against Ovarian Cancer. These programs are diverse in their application, covering everything from the promotion of knowledge regarding risk factors to securing lab time for researchers across the globe.
