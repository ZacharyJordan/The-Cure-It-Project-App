   It has been discovered that nearly all cases of Skin Cancer can be prevented long before they become life threatening. This is due to the visible nature of the disease, as it often makes itself present in the form of visible sores and harsh rashes.

    <p class = "whiten">
     It is for this reason that there has been a recent movement to promote public education regarding these terrible cancers, as increased awareness will undoubtably save lives as people learn to check themselves for signs of Skin Cancer and take steps to prevent themselves from ever contracting it in the first place.

 Physicians have recently developed a simple system that will hopefully aid in the early detection of Melanoma, the deadliest form of Skin Cancer. Called the ABCDE system, it involves the self-examination of moles for visible features that are consistent with what one would find in a case of Melanoma. This allows people to sort the normal from the irregular, and will hopefully assist in the protection of people against the threat of developing Skin Cancers.

Additionally, the increased understanding of the causes of Skin Cancer has afforded people the opportunity to take steps to prevent themselves from contracting Skin Cancer in the first place. For instance, the discovery of the role of UV rays in the development of Skin Cancer has prompted a movement to educate people on the harms of these rays, and the reasonable steps that they can take to avoid them.
