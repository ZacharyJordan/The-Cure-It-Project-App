   Like Intraocular Melanomas, Intraocular Lymphomas involve a broader type of cancer: Lymphoma. The difference between Intraocular Lymphoma and standard Lymphoma is based on location, as Intraocular Lymphomas occur in the ocular region of the head. Lymphoma is defined as the uninhibited growth of lypmph nodes.

     Lypmph nodes regulate important parts of the immune system, and are typically only visible when swollen. Such swelling can indicate major problems in whatever region of the body it occurs in. In this case, the swelling occurs in the ocular region.

Intraocular Melanomas, while still dangerous, only account for around 7% of all Eye Cancer cases in the world - a very small number when compared to Intraocular Melanoma. The diagnosis of Intraocular Lymphoma is typically made by removing cells from the eye and evaluating it from there. Once the diagnosis is certain, a specialized doctor is dispached to perform an evaluation on how the patient should proceed.

Thankfully, the symptoms of Intraocular Lymphoma are often quite distinguishable, something which makes early detection more likely. Noticing and alerting a doctor of these symptoms is an essentail step in terms of ensuring a high chance of survival.

These symptoms share much in common with the other 2 primary types of Eye Cancer, and can include things like blurred vision and an altered pupil shape. Some of the more unique symptoms are Lymphoma-specific, such as swelling of the face as a reaction to the mass growth of lypmph nodes.
