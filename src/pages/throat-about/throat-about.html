    <p class = "whiten">
     Throat Cancer is an aggressive cancer that has two forms: laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, both four-stage cancers. In 2015, there are 13,560 new cases of laryngeal cancer with 3,640 deaths resulting from the cancer.

    <p class = "whiten">
      Although it is aggressive, laryngeal cancer rates are decreasing as less people are smoking. Throat Cancer, like many other cancers, don’t have an exact cause, but there are certain risk factors that can intensify or increase the chances of one obtaining Throat Cancer.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
  Throat cancers are often grouped with other cancers of the mouth and throat, and as a result, share similar risk factors like tobacco use, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections, and age. Still, avoiding controllable factors like drugs and tobacco can greatly reduce the risk of having throat cancers.

It's important to remember that the earlier any form of cancer is detected, the easier it is to completely get rid of it, and Throat Cancer is a cancer that can easily be diagnosed.

    <p class = "whiten">
Some of noticeable symptoms include: hoarseness or voice changes (especially when the problem lasts 2 weeks or more), sore throat that doesn’t go away, constant coughing, and pain while swallowing. The symptoms related to the cancer are common to symptoms of the flu or common cold, but there is no harm in asking a doctor if you think the symptoms may be related to a cancer.
