    Evaluating whether a Brain Cancer is Primary or Secondary is an essential step in terms of developing an effective treatment plan. A Primary Brain Cancer is one that has started either in the brain or in related structures. A Secondary Brain Cancer is one that began in another part of the body, but spread to the brain after a period of development.

     Only about 20 percent of Brain Cancers are primary. This means that while primary brain tumors only account for around 2 percent of all cancer cases in adults, the reach of Brain Cancer indirectly harms thousands more through secondary brain tumors.

  It is also worth noting that while the causes of Primary Brain Cancer remain largely unknown, it has been theorized that some inherited conditions could increase the risk of this form of cancer. More research is needed in order to develop both our understanding of what causes Brain Cancer and the steps that we can take to avoid it.
