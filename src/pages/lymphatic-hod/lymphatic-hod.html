    Hodgkin's Disease (sometimes referred to as HD) attacks the same area that Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma does: the lymphocytes. Hodgkin's Disease takes over these cells, and in doing so weakens the immune system.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     This has the adverse effect of making the body more prone to sickness. Because of this, the symptoms of Hodgkin's Disease are very similar to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
One of the most important factors in ensuring that Hodgkin's Disease is dealt with effectively is the stage at which the cancer is discovered.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
This can be seen through analyzing the relative survival rates by stage that those who contract the disease have historically faced. While the prognosis for the first 2 stages is relatively positive, with 90 percent of patients surviving 5 years or more, only 65 percent of patients whose cancer was discovered in stage IV achieved this same milestone.
