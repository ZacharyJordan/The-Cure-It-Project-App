    Recent research has done much to provide new options to doctors and patients alike through the development of life-saving drugs. Because Ovarian Cancer is so difficult to detect at an early stage, many scientists have directed their efforts instead to dealing with Ovarian Cancer in its more advanced stages. This allows the sickest of the sick to be met with new treatments that provide them with hope when previously there was none.

     One such treatment comes in the form of a particularly intensive chemotherapy. It has been a revolutionary force where it was applied, with a whopping 65 percent increase in success rate among patients whose first attempt at chemotherapy failed.

 This is especially important because the women involved in the experiment were very limited in their options, meaning that the treatment was instrumental in opening the door to a healthier, happier life.

Also suprising was the relative lack of side effects that the women who participated in the experiment faced. This, combined with the fact that the drugs applied are readily avaliable from most major medical facilities across the globe, means that the treatment could prove to be effective in shaping the standards that currently define Ovarian Cancer treatment.

While such research is still in its infancy and thus required further refinement before it can be applied on a larger scale, it still serves as a beacon of hope in many ways, providing good news on a front where such successes is rare. As Sir Paul Nurse, director general of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund put it, "We've been waiting for good news on ovarian cancer for some time, so the results of this study are very encouraging".
