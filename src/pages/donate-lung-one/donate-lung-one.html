  The Lung Cancer Foundation of America is an organization based in the United States that has set their sights on one tremendous goal: establishing groundbreaking results in the field of Lung Cancer treatment. They hope that their work will one day improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of Lung Cancer patients on both national and global levels.

In order to accomplish this, the LCFA works to raise both the funds and the national profile of Lung Cacner in order to substantially increase support of innovative research efforts that save lives.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They strive to communicate their goals in a way that is both direct and exceedingly clear, and as such have created a promotional video that details the specifics of this wonderful center for transformative science in the area of Lung Cancer treatment.

As worthy as their cause is, this foundation would be ultimately unable to make an impact without the support of the public.
