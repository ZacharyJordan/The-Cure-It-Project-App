     Thankfully, Basal Cell Cardinomas are nearly always a relatively unaggressive form of Skin Cancer and typically do not spread beyond the original tumor site. However, Basal Cell Cardinoma Skin Cancer that is left untreated can result in severe disfigurement.

    <p class = "whiten">
Despite a steady increase in occurance in the United States over the past decade and a half, less than 1 percent of Basal Cell Cardinoma Skin Cancers prove to be fatal. The slow-moving nature of the cancer often affords doctors the opportunity to apply a wide variety of treatment techniques, which usually result in the elimination of the disease before it can inflict serious damage on the patient.
