      <p class = "whiten">
     In its most basic form, Thyroid Cancer is defined as the uncontrollable growth of cells in the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland located just below the center of the neck.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      There are 3 primary types of Thyroid Cancers: Papillary Carcinomas, Follicular Carcinomas, and Hurthle Cell Carcinomas. All of these will be discussed in great detail.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       As shown through the graph below, Papillary Carcinomas are easily the most common types of Bone Cancer, accounting for 80% of all Thyroid Cancer cases. This is followed by Follicular Carcinomas, and finally, Hurthle Cell Carcinomas.

      <p class = "whiten">
        As illustrated by the chart above, Papillary Carcinomas are the most frequent form of Thyroid Cancer. Before discussing this disease in detail, it is essential to first understand the implications of the cancer in regards to its location in the thyroid.

      <p class = "whiten">
      Follicular Carcinomas are a relatively rare subset of Thyroid Cancer, accounting for just 17% of total cases. They share many similarities with Papillary Carcinomas, and as such are often described as being a specific varient of that form of Thyroid Cancer.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       Both spread relatively easily, and both oiginate within the thyroid. However, there are a few differences that set it apart from other varients of Thyroid Cancer.

      <p class = "whiten">
       Hurthle Cell Carcinomas (sometimes referred to as HCCs) are the rarest form of Thyroid Cancer. Just as Follicular Carcinomas are varients of Papillary Carcinomas, HCCs are varients of Follicular Carcinomas.

      <p class = "whiten">
       Radioactive Iodine is one of the most exciting new developments in the field of Thyroid Cancer research. They exist as a relative noninvasive means to treat particularly advanced cases of Thyroid Cancer, and can even be used in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond its point of origin. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
   Thyroid cells are one of the few cells in the body that possess the mechanisms to properly absorb and concentrate Iodine. Medical professionals take advantage of this fact by inserting radioactive iodine into the bloodstream of the patient.
