    Bile Duct Cancers are a rare form of cancer that starts in the thin tubes that reach from the liver to the small intestine. It is fairly uncommon in the United States, accounting for about only 2,000-3,000 of the 33,000 cases of Liver Cancer that occur there each year.

     That said, it is much more common in parts of Southeast Asia due to the relative prominence of a parasitic infection that has been linked to causing Bile Duct Cancer.

The disease is largely considered to be quite severe, with 5-year survival rates ranging anywhere from 50 percent to 2 percent depending on when the cancer was discovered and how effective the treatment is. Also worth noting is that the risk of Bile Duct Cancer increases with age, with the majority of cases occuring in people above the age of 70.
