    Your salivary glands are responsible for creating saliva, a lubricating substance involved in the early process of digesting food. Salivary Gland Carcinomas are classified when abnormal cells begin to disrupt this bodily function. They are relatively uncommon, only accounting for about 3 percent of head and neck tumors.

     Luckily, the prognosis for those who contract this form of cancer is usually fairly positive, with around 72 percent of people diagnosed with Salivary Gland Carcinomas surviving 5 years or more. Even so, more research is necessary to identify new treatment procedures that could improve these odds even further.

    <p class = "whiten">
 The largest currently identified risk factor associated with Salivary Gland Carcinomas is age and gender, as the chance of contracting this disease is highest in males past the age of 50.

 That said, there do exist some other proposed conditions that some studies have suggested may increase the risk of a particular individual contracting a Salivary Gland Carcinoma. A diet low in vegetables and high in animal fat, for instance, has been proposed as one such condition.
