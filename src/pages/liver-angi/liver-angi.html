    Angiosarcomas and Hemangiosarcomas are both extremely rare varients of Liver Cancer. Angiosarcoma, for instance, accounts for just 1 percent of all Liver Cancers. That said, it can still be incredibly dangerous.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Angiosarcomas are often very difficult to detect, partly because they begin in the blood vessels of the liver. This means that they are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, something that can limit treatment options.

    <p class = "whiten">
 Hemangiosarcoma is a form of cancer that can sometimes originate in the blood vessels of the liver. While it occurs most often in animals - particularly dogs - the extremely aggressive nature of the disease warrants serious precautions. The symptoms of Hemangiosarcoma can often remain virtually invisible until the disease is in its advanced stages, something which makes early detection very difficult to achieve.
