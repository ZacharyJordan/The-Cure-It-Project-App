    Chondrosarcomas are different from other forms of Bone Cancer in one very specific way. Instead of infecting hard bones, Chondrosarcomas actually attack the cartilage in the body. They are still capable of forming in the hips, ribs, and arm bones, but the key difference is that they can attack places with cartilage.

     The symptoms of Chondrosarcomas often make it difficult to detect. In fact, those who contract Chondrosarcoma typically do not feel sick. Instead, time will reveal other symptoms, such as boney protrusions, difficulty with advanced movement, or a feeling of dull pain.

  Because these symptoms are often not percieved as being cancerous, some patients will fail to deal with the problem appropriately and thus will have a more difficult time dealing with their cancer. As with all Bone Cancers, early treatment is a necessity in terms of ensuring that an effective recovery is enjoyed by the patient.
