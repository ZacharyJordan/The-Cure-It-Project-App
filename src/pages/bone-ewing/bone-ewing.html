     Ewing Tumors are relatively uncommon, accounting for just 34 percent of all Bone Cancer cases. They usually form in the same spots as Osteosarcomas, but there are a few noteable exceptions to this generalization. That is, they have been known to form in the cavities of the leg and arm bones, and can also form in soft tissues of the body near bones.

     Ewing Tumors are a bit different than Osteosarcomas in that they form from primitive cells. Primitive cells are the oldest cells in the body. One common misconception is that this results in different treatment - Ewing Tumors still contain the same DNA abnormalities, and respond to most methods of treatement the same way other cancerous cells do.

  The survival rates of Ewing Tumors are especially noteworthy due the relationship that they appear to have with the age of the patient. For example, about 70 percent of children with Ewing Tumors survive five years or more. Unfortunately, people aged between 15 and 19 suffer a significantly lower survival rate of about 56 percent.

   As of now, there are no identifiable environmental factors that contribute to the development of Ewing Tumors. The only way to protect someone from this disease is to be proactive in making healthy decisions and taking care to ensure that any problems are diagnosed as soon as possible.

    All of the most common side effects, while unpleasant, were ultimately completely treatable and did not affect the patients in the long term.

  Waiting too long to be examined by a doctor is a mistake that costs lives.
