  Metastatic Breast Cancer is classified when the cancer has spread to other organs in the body. It is sometimes also referred to as stage IV Breast Cancer. It is generally uncommon for Metastatic Breast Cancer to be declared upon an initial diagnosis, as it typically develops after completing treatment for an earlier stage of Breast Cancer.

  Deaths resulting from Breast Cancer do not come from cancer that remains in the breast. The transportation of dangerous cancer cells to vital positions in the body such as the bones, liver, or brain is what actually threatens life.

 Thus, the approximately 40,000 annual deaths in the US that result from Breast Cancer all spawn from those who were suffering from Metastatic Breast Cancer.

Before one can begin to grasp what it is like to live with Metastatic Breast Cancer, it is essential to first understand that the disease is something that persistantly weights on those inflicted with it throughout the course of their entire lives.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
      While gradual improvements have been seen in recent years, it is possible for the cancer to resurface decades after the completion of successful treatement, something which ensures that it is rare for the battle to be truly over for those that suffer from Metastatic Breast Cancer.
