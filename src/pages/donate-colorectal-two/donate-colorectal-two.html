  The NCCRA (National Colorectal Cancer Alliance) has made it their mission to eradicate the threat of Colorectal Cancers for everyone.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They attempt to do this by promoting and raising funds for medical screenings, scientific tests, and treatments. They hope that their efforts will one day prove successful enough to yield a cure, and have selflessly pursued this goal since their founding in 2000. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They have raised well over 33 million dollars to date, and have provided thousands of patients with advanced technologies that make their lives more comfortable and fulfilling.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
One such advancement that they have funded has been the development of a DNA-based stool test that can detect the gene mutation that has been associated with the development of Colorectal Cancers. This provides researchers everywhere with more data with which to construct future treatment plans. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
All of this has been accomplished while ensuring a great deal of financial transparency. They keep detailed records as to where donations are directed towards, and maintain a running list of where the most prominent investments lie.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
It is through such contributions that researchers around the world can harness the tools that they need to make the issue of Colorectal Cancers one of the past.
    </p>
