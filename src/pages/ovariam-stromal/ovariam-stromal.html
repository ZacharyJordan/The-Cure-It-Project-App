    Stromal Tumors are an especially rare type of Ovarian Cancer. They develop from the cell tissue that is typically responsible for producing female hormones. One of the largest issues with Stromal Tumor treatment is the issue of recurrence, as Stromal Tumors have been known to come back years after substantial remission has occured. This means that patients can rarely consider themselves 'cured', as the threat of the cancer coming back is a persistent one.

     That said, the actual severity of Stromal Tumors is typically fairly mild when compared with other forms of Ovarian Cancer. For instance, the tumors are almost always slow growing, which provides doctors and patients with ample time to generate an effective treatment program.

 or this reason and the fact that the tumors are typically limited to one or both Ovaries, and is thus unlikely to spread beyond the point of origin, Stromal Tumors are sometimes considered to be a low-grade cancer. This means that survival and recovery outlooks are positive for patients of this distinction.
