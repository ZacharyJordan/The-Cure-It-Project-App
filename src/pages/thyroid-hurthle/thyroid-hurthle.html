    Hurthle Cell Carcinomas (sometimes referred to as HCCs) are the rarest form of Thyroid Cancer. Just as Follicular Carcinomas are varients of Papillary Carcinomas, HCCs are varients of Follicular Carcinomas.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      This form of cancer attacks the Hurthle Cells. These cells are ripe with cytoplasm, and when infected can disable the mitochondria. This in turn reduces the amount of energy being produced for the body, thus debilitating the health of the patient.

   While many of the symptoms do not differ from the other two forms of cancer discussed above, the most important thing to take into consideration is how easily it can spread. The true danger of this disease lies in how easily it can metastasize around the body, affecting other organs necessary for survival.
