  At its most basic level, Recurrent Breast Cancer is Breast Cancer that returns after initial treatement. This is often very difficult to detect and eliminate because initial treatements are designed with the intent of eliminating all cancerous cells, meaning that some patients let their guard down after completion. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
  There are three primary forms of recurrence: local, regional, and distant. Local and regional recurrence both imply that the cancer has resurfaced at a similar location as the original cancer.

    <p class = "whiten">
 The familiar nature of treatement at this point often means more effective and comfortable treatement for the patient. Distant recurrence happens when the cancer has traveled to unfamiliar parts of the body, meaning that treatement must adapt to better suit the new location. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
In both cases, the symptoms of Recurrent Breast Cancer are often very visible, consisting of irritated or marble-like skin lumps centered around the upper chest. Such findings often prompt further investigations which can lead to the early identification of Recurrent Breast Cancer, something that is essential in terms of ensuring that aggressive treatement remains an option.
