  Recent discoveries have done much to allow researchers to utilize various drug combinations in their efforts to boost the survival rate of Colorectal Cancer patients. These drugs provide patients everywhere with more options, something that serves to enhance the comfort and health of those suffering from the disease. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
  One of these drugs is Irinotecan, which is a chemotherapy drug that specifically attempts to block the action of an enzyme associated with keeping cancer cells in their proper form. Cancer cells typically divide far faster than healthy cells, and thus are more likely to be targeted by the drug.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
While side effects do exist, Irinotecan has proved itself to be a valuable tool in the arsenal of doctors, and has kept people healthy since its approval by the FDA in 1996. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 Another drug recently approved for the treatment of Colorectal Cancers is Eloxatin. While it is typically used in combination with other drugs, the use of Eloxatin has been associated with a whopping 11 percent in 5-year survival rates in some cases. It is through advancements such as these that we can give hope to those who may otherwise have very little.
