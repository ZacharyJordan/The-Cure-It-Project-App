    The Testicular Cancer Society has taken a varied and aggressive approach in their fight against Testicular Cancers. They attempt to raise awareness about the harms of the disease while also offering support to those who are already suffering from it. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
From one on one support to information regarding the proper way to perform a self-check for Testicular Cancer, the Testicular Cancer Society has taken meaningful strides towards a future free from the confusion and feeling of hopelessness that is sometimes associated with something as serious as cancer.
      </p>

      <p class="whiten">
They also make it incredibly easy for others to get involved in their mission, and as such have created a page that details the steps that can be taken to support their operations. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
Testicular Cancer is a disease that thrives when given time to develop, so ensuring that the general public is properly informed as to the signs of the illness is an essential part of ensuring that it is effectively dealt with.
