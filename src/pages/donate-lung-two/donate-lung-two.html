  SmokeFree.gov is a little bit different from the other organizations that we've promoted in that it doesn't actually cater to the treatment of Lung Cancer specifically. Rather, it attempts to undermine the #1 cause of Lung Cancer: smoking.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Smoking is easily the most dangerous and most prevalent cause of Lung Cancers, increasing the risk of contracting the disease by a factor of 15 to 30 in some cases. While smoking, the body inhales 7000 different chemicals, 70 of which have been directly linked to cancer in humans.

This wonderful resource provides many tools and resources, but they all link back to one central purpose: to ensure that you and the people around you are able to stay free of smoking, and as such are able to live a healthy life free from worry.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
They provide all the guides and advice necessary to accomplish this goal, and strive to make it easy to develop a simple "quitting plan" that is uniquely suited for the individual in question.

A short description of the website is insufficient in demonstrating the excellence of its purpose. You can click the button below to be directed to the website, and find guides and tips to help bring smoking and its harms to an end.
