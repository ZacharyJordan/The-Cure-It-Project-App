    <p class = "whiten">
     Skin Cancer is a disease in which a group of Skin Cells begins dividing uncontrollably due to a series of mutations and genetic defects, thus resulting in cancerous tumors. All Skin Cancers can be grouped into several primary categories.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      For the sake of education, we will simplify these categories into three main groups: Melanoma, Basal Cell Cardinoma, and Squamous Cell Carinoma. Basal Cell Cardinoma and Squamous Cell Carinoma have many similarities, and as such are sometimes referred to as non-melanoma skin cancers.

    <p class = "whiten">
  Skin Cancer is extraordinarily far-reaching in its impacts in that it is the most common of all currently existing cancers. In fact, Skin Cancer accounts for nearly half of all cancer cases in the United States. Because these numbers are so inclusive, everyone is potentially at risk for the development of Skin Cancer.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
That said, there do exist several external factors that can result in a higher risk for contracting this terrible disease. These include: A family history of Skin Cancer, pale skin, unprotected exposure, and a weakened immune system.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
Keep in mind that Melanoma accounts for less than 2 percent of all currently diagnosed Skin Cancers, a shocking figure when one considers the number of deaths that they cause. Simply put, while the other forms of Skin Cancer certainly warrant further research, it is Melanoma that claims the vast majority of lives in regards to Skin Cancers.
