    Myeloablative Therapy is one of the most interesting treatment innovations that has been refined over the past couple of years. It works by using powerful forms of chemotherapy to attack cancerous cells, especially those that have spread throughout the body.

      While the overbearing nature of the treatment typicaly results in severe side effects, it can prove effective for patients who have exhausted all other options. In fact, this specific form of treatment is almost always followed by stem cell therapy that can reconstruct the bone marrow that was damaged or destroyed by the cancer and its treatment.

 In this way, Myeloablative Therapy constructs the foundation upon which long-term health can be achieved. This is only scratching the surface of what modern science has brought to the world in terms of treatment options, and offers hope for what the future holds in store for us.
