    Seminomas are one of the two primary forms of Testicular Cancer. A Seminoma is a form of cancer that begins in the cells that produces sperm.

    <p class = "whiten">
      Due to their place of origin, this form of Testicular Cancer typically is not extremely aggressive and as such is usually fairly treatable.

  Seminomas develop and spread slowly relative to Nonseminomas. They have been known to respond well to radiation-based therapy. In short, the slow moving nature of this disease typically provides doctors and patients alike with ample time to develop and execute a proper medical plan to combat the tumor, something that explains the low mortality rates of the illness.
