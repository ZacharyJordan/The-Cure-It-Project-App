    <p class = "answer special-answer">Some of the names in this interview may have been changed to protect the identity of those involved.</p>
    <p class = "question">When and how did you first find out you had cancer?</p>
  
    <p class = "answer">
    I should preface this by mentioning that when I was 16, I found a bump on my arm. Every doctor I saw from 16 to 21 that I asked about it would poke it, give me an annoyed look and say, "It's a muscle, don't worry about it." 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
      Because I was just a teenager and they had medical degrees, I ignored it for years, only bringing it up whenever I met a new doctor. Four different doctors and one nurse physician assistant all assured me that the pain was normal or in my head. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
      I first found out that I had cancer in 2011. The bump on my arm that I'd had for years had been hurting more and more lately, and it was starting to affect my ability to do my job.
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    At the time I was a clerk at a grocery store, and I would spend my shift bringing in carts and then go into the break room and cry from the pain on my breaks. Finally a coworker insisted I see a doctor, and took my shift so I'd be able to. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    I went to a walk in clinic in a Los Angeles suburb where the fifth doctor I'd seen in six years about my arm became the first to want an X-ray of it, and only because he thought I'd torn my rotor cuff. He told me to come back the next day for the results.
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
      The next day he wasn't in, and it was left to a poor nurse to tell me, on my birthday, that the mass in my arm was consistent with bone cancer, and I needed to see an oncologist immediately. 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Personally I never felt embarrassed or afraid to talk to my doctors. I just didn't know enough at the time to push the issue. It's weird to think sometimes how different things would have been if I had. 
    </p>

    <p class = "question">
    How has having cancer influenced your relationships with friends and family members?
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    My friends and family were concerned. My mother, of course, was (and still is) a nervous wreck. At the time I was living 8 hours away from all my family and pretty much everyone I knew. A lot of my friends didn't seem to understand how serious things were, unless they'd been touched by cancer in their own lives.
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    Everyone mostly assumed that though it sucked, I'd get through it and my life would go on. After all, I was young, and people as young as I am don't die to diseases like cancer, right? 
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    For my family it was different. My grandma was very sick at the time from lung cancer, advanced skin cancer and dementia.
    </p>

    <p class = "answer">
    My family knew things could go from bad to worse quickly, and dealing with their worries and fears wasn't something I could handle on top of my own, so I buried mine, decided I was fine and put on a brave face for everyone. Because of that, when things got really bad no one really knew. At one point I almost died in the ICU but I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want anyone to worry.
