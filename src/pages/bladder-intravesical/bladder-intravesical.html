     Intravesical immunotherapy is a promising new style of Bladder Cancer treatment. Doctors administer drugs to a patient’s bladder by directly introducing them via a catheter instead of giving the patient a pill or an injection. This method can be used to deliver chemotherapy drugs, but is more commonly used for delivering immunotherapy drugs.

     Often times, Bladder Cancers can be made much worse by a bacteria commonly present in human bodies: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. Now, doctors are taking to giving patients dead forms of BCG using intravesical therapy and enabling them to quickly develop antibodies suited to killing BCG in their immune system. While this may not cure Bladder Cancer entirely, it can stop it from getting worse, and can often cause remission for Stage I patients.

Additionally, intravesical immunotherapy involves doctors introducing compounds called interferons to patients’ bladders. Interferons are synthesized compounds that are highly effective at stimulating the immune system at desired areas.

  The intravesical method enables doctors to administer interferons and stimulate the immunse system right where it is needed to kill off cancer cells and stop tumor growths. Although the success rate for more advanced cancer is relative low, the treatment is notable for prompting remission in Stage I patients.
