   The Thyroid Cancer Survivors' Association is an expansive organization that is an expansive organization that has selflessly dedicated itself to the eradication of Thyroid Cancers. They pursue this ambitious goal on four equally important fronts: 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      1) To educate, so that families can beter understand the disease. <br />
      2) To participate, so people can learn from the experiences of others. <br />
      3) To communicate, so everyone can better understand the needs of others. <br />
      4) To support research, for a future free of thyroid cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
The organization has made a targeted effort to act on levels both local and global in order to accomplish these goals.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
In accordance with this fact, they sponsor support groups that are active on the internet and in individualized communities as well as provide resources to better help physicians and patients alike come to terms with the many complexities of Thyroid Cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
All of these outreach efforts would be impossible without the continued support of the public. Thyroid Cancer kills through a failure to discover the disease early, so such efforts are instrumental in saving lives through the promotion of scientific knowledge and innovation.
