    A common way to rid early stage Throat Cancers is to use radiation therapy. Although the cost is much higher than other methods, it can kill cancer cells and not damage vocal chords, allowing patients to speak normally. It may be used after surgery to try to lower the risk that the cancer will come back.

     There are even more different types of radiation therapy, but the most common type is external beam radiation therapy. External beam radiation therapy focuses radiation on a certain part of your body. Patients using this therapy usually have a schedule of daily doses of 5 days per week, for about 7 weeks.

 While radiation therapy is a strong and effective method of removing throat cancer, it can include multiple side effects and can worsen the cancer if patients are participating in controllable risk factors. Smoking or alcohol use can greatly can come in conflict with the radiation therapy and worsen pre-existing conditions in a patient.

Also, the rate or pace at which the therapy occurs can increase the risk of severe side effects. Accelerated fractionation, a shorter term schedule of radiation therapy, delivers radiation at higher doses which can kill the cancer faster or reduce the risk of it coming back but also run the risk of creating stronger side effects.

For both types of throat cancers, the number of cases has decreased over time. Specifically, death rates have been falling on average 2.3% each year over 2003-2012.

This can be attributed to the dwindling number of people smoking, specifically cigarettes. Generally, the survival rate has increased as well with better and more efficient technology.
