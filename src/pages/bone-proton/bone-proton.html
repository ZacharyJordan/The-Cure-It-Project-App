    One of the most exciting developments in the field of Bone Cancer treatment has presented itself in the form of Proton Therapy. Proton Therapy offers an alternative to complete surgery, and is especially useful in cases where the bone in question cannot be moved or shifted without harming the patient. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      Proton Therapy works by targeting certain forms of Bone Cancer with a beam of protons. This high degree of precision allows doctors to deliver radiation to tumors without harming nearby healthy tissue.

    <p class = "whiten">
 This means that Proton Therapy is effective in subverting many of the side effects that often accompany similar radiation-based therapies, thus resulting in a more comfortable and effective treatment program for the patient. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
This form of treatment has proven to be indispensable in the treatment of children and young adults due to the comparatively unaggressive way in which it targets unhealthy areas of the body. While Proton Therapy doesn't completely remove side effects, it is effective in making them easier to deal with while also effectively dealing with tumerous cells.
