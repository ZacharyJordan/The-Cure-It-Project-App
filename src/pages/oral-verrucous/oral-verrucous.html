    Verrucous Carcinomas are a relatively rare varient of Squamous Cell Carcinomas, accounting for around 5 percent of all oral cavity cancers. It is typically very slow growing, which means that it rarely spreads to other parts of the body. However, it can become deeply infused with the oral cavity, something which sometimes results in the degredation of the jaw bone or similar features.

     Early treatment is important with this form of cancer, as Verrucous Carcinomas can sometimes spawn cases of Squamous Cell Carcinomas. These Squamous Cell Carcinoma cells are not constrained by the slow-moving nature of Verrucous Carcinomas, and as such have the ability to spread to other parts of the body.

This means that the danger of Verrucous Carcinomas has the potential to increase significantly over time, turning a very treatable condition into one that can sometimes spiral out of control.

Verrucous Carcinomas are especially common males above the age of 60 years old. However, it is occurring in young people more and more due to a recent willingness to partake in chewing tobacco or using snuff orally. Both of these things increase the risk of contracting this cancer so much that it is sometimes referred to as "Snuff dipper's cancer".
