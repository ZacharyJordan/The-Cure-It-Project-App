    Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (also called NSC Lung Cancer for short) is by far the most common type of Lung Cancer, accounting for around 85% percent of total Lung Cancer cases. To fully appreciate the impact that NSC Lung Cancer has on the body, it is important to first grasp a basic understanding of lung functioning.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     When you breathe in, fresh oxygen is directed towards your bronchi. The bronchi consists of two large tubes that feed into the lungs, eventually branching off into smaller brances called bronchioles.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 The clean oxygen is held in tiny sacks in these bronchioles, and the blood pumping through your body absorbs that oxygen and replaces it with non-reusable carbon dioxide. Once the carbon dioxide is held in the alveoli sacks, you breathe it out, thus keeping your body running properly with the oxygen and blood composition it needs to survive.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     When NSC Lung Cancer is formed, it almost always starts in the tiny branches of the bronchioles. The disease typically remains very low profile at these early stages, with scientific instruments being required to detect the abnormal cells. Over time, the abnormal cells may acquire other gene changes, something which can cause them to progress to true cancer. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     As the cancer develops, the tumerous cells may produce chemicals that causes new blood vessels to form nearby. These blood vessels nourish the cancerous cells, which can continue to grow and form a tumor large enough to be seen on imaging tests such as x-rays. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     As noted above, body processes blood through tiny sacs called alveoli. This system is extremely effective in carrying the cancer cells to other parts of the body. The survival rates associated with NSC Lung Cancer reflect this, as early detection and removal of the disease is essential in terms of guaranteeing an effective recovery.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     For instance, the five-year survival rate for cases in which the cancer is discovered in stage I is 45% or higher, whereas stage IV patients only meet this same milestone about 1% of the time.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     The symptoms of NSC Lung Cancer worsen in direct proportion to the amount of time that the tumor remains untreated. Because the cancer restricts oxygen transfer to the blood, the symptoms of NSC Lung Cancer can include raspy sounding breathing, coughing up blood or other substances, and lasting lung problems like Pneumonia and Bronchitis.
