     Chemotherapy is, simply put, the use of drugs to eliminate dangerous cancer cells. A negative stigma has been attached to Chemotherapy in years past due to the harmful side effects that this type of treatement has been known to sometimes generate. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      However, recent years have brought with them innovations that have made these drugs not only more comfortable to experience, but also more effective in targeting the specific cells that must be removed from the body. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 Modern Chemotherapy drugs have been engineered to attack specific targets on cancer cells in an effort to increase effectiveness while minimizing adverse health effects. To do this, doctors attach special proteins to the drugs which allow them to be guided directly to the cancer cells.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   This means that the chemotherapy drugs are more effective in striking at the root of the problem whilst also decreasing the number of non-cancer cells effected.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   One of the most innovative improvements to Chemotherapy has been achieved through the use of a technique in which the drug is packaged inside a liposome. This allows the drug to actively degraded specifically in the tumor tissue, thus minimising the risk of side effects such as nausea and hair loss.
