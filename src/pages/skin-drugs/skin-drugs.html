    The aggressive nature of Melanoma Skin Cancer means that the likelihood of it responding positively to chemotherapy treatements is often quite low. While it can sometimes shrink tumors by as much as 15 percent, this is usually not enough to improve the survival rate of the patient as a whole.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Thankfully, the emergence of new drugs such as Vemurafenib and Ipilimumab have the potential to transform Skin Cancer treatements as we know them, giving hope to patients that have otherwise exhausted all other options.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 There exists within about 50 percent of Melanomas a gene called BRAF that assists in cell growth. A Phase III clinical trial analyzed the impact of Vemurafenib targeting the BRAF gene and the resulting effect that this had on overall survival rates. What they found was extraordinary, with a 63 percent increase in overall survival rates in patients whose cancer was otheriwse untreated and considered inoperable.

     <p class = "whiten">
A seperate Phase III clinical trial combined Ipilimumab with traditional chemotherapy treatements to isolate the effect that the drug had on the survival rates of Skin Cancer patients. The results were extremely encouraging, with a whopping 8.6 percent increase in three-year survival rates when compared to those that did not recieve Ipilimumab. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
The impact of this study becomes even more significant when one considers that the trial included over 500 patients with Melanoma that could not be surgically removed, thus presenting them with life-saving options that did not exist in years past.
