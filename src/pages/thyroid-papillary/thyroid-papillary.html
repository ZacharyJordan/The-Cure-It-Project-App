    Papillary Carcinomas are the most frequent form of Thyroid Cancer. Before discussing this disease in detail, it is essential to first understand the implications of the cancer in regards to its location in the thyroid. The main purpose of the thyroid to regulate the prominence of certain hormones by sending them to key points in the body.

     This means that the thyroid has access to nearly every major organ in the body, something that enables cancerous cells to spread quickly and broadly. This fact makes the early discovery of Thyroid Cancer especially important.

  Papillary Carcinomas, intuitively enough, first develop in the thyroid area. The most common physical indication of this form of cancer comes in the form of a large lump on the throat, usually larger than what the adams apple would be for a male.

  There do exist other means of discovering this disease, such as blood tests and biopsies, but the largely visible nature of the illness makes early visual identification a distinct possibility.

 This subset of Thyroid Cancer has the best prognosis for all forms of the disease, with 90 percent of all victims surviving 10 years or more past the initial time of diagnosis. This has largely been attributed to the symptoms of the disease, which include: intense and sharp pain in the neck and swelling in the thyroid.

 While these symptoms may sound unpleasant, their easily noticeable nature actually saves lives by making it easier for the disease to be discovered in its earlier stages.
