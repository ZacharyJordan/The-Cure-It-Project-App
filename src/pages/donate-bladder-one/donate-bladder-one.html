  The Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network uses a variety of angles to combat Bladder Cancer. It is led by a panel of urologists, oncologists, radiation oncologists and pathologists known as the Scientific Advisory Board that convenes to guide BCANâ€™s research efforts as knowledge of Bladder Cancer grows.

These scientists and doctors are some of the leading experts in their respective fields, and you can find a complete list of the members of the SAB here.

      One way BCAN fights Bladder Cancer is through active medical research. It offers three Young Investigator Awards to graduate students conducting research on Bladder Cancer. These $100,000 research grants fund researchers who work in basic, translational, clinical, epidemiologic, bioengineering or any other scientific or research field, and are also working in a research environment capable of supporting transformational Bladder Cancer research.

Additionally, BCAN offers the John Quale Travel Fellowship.

    <p class = "whiten">
      Bladder Cancer thrives on misinformation and ignorance, so BCAN uses a variety of education and support communities to attack to eventually render the lack of information a non-issue. For those worried about Bladder Cancer, BCAN offers the Patient Insight Webinar Series: freely available recordings of lectures given by BCAN associates on a variety of topics surrounding Bladder Cancer.

    <p class = "whiten">
    For those afflicted with this disease, BCAN offers support through the BCAN Online Support Community and the In Person Support Groups.
