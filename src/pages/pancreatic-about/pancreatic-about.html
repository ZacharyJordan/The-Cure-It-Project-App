     Pancreatic Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases currently operating in the world today. While it is relatively rare compared to other forms of cancer, the prognosis can often be quite dire for those that suffer from it. This unfortunate fact can even hold true in cases in which the cancer is diagnosed and treated early in its development, although such a situation can benefit the outlook of the disease when compared to its later stages.

      Pancreatic Cancers typically spread rapidly from their point of origin and are rarely discovered in their earliest stages. There are two major types of Pancreatic Cancer: Exocrine Tumors and Endocrine Tumors.

Its function in the body is essential: it secretes hormones and sends them to glands in order to perform routine body functions like digesting fat and protein, spreading oxygen to the body, and producing excitatory hormones like dopamine and adrenaline.

Pancreatic Cancer involves the uncontrollable growth of pancreatic cells that form tumors that impede the normal functioning of the pancreas and its satellite organs.
