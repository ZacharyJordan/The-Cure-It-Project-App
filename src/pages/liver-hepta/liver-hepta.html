    Despite being strangely rare in the United States, Hepatocellular Carcinomas are by far the most common form of Liver Cancer. In fact, they have risen in prominence in recent years to become the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with well over 500,000 people affected.

     In the past, Hepatocellular Carcinomas were extremely difficult to detect, something which meant that diagnosals were often only made once the disease had reached an advanced stage. However, modern screening techniques have made it easier to recognize this disease before it becomes exceedingly dangerous.

 The severity of this form of Liver Cancer can often be intimidating. If the tumor cannot be completely removed, it is not uncommon for the disease to prove fatal within 3 to 6 months. That said, early detection and aggressive treatment can go a long way in slowing down or preventing advanced development of the disease.
