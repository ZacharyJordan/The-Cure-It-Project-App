    <p class = "whiten">
     Testicular Cancer is, as the name implies, cancer that originates in the testis. The testis are largely considered to be the most important element of the male reproductive system, as they contain the glands in which spermatoza (commonly known as sperm) and testosterone are created.

    <p class = "whiten">
      The two main types of Testicular Cancer are Seminomas and Nonseminoas, both of which are covered in great detail on other pages of this section.

  It is an extremely rare form of cancer, occuring in less than half a percent of males in a given year. Despite this, Testicular Cancer is currently the most common form of cancer found in men between the ages of 15 and 35.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
This fact has resulted in an estimated 195,000 men with a history of Testicular Cancer in the United States alone. It is also one of the more treatable cancers, accounting for only a tenth of a percent of total cancer deaths.
    </p>

From this, we can see that the silver lining to a Testicular Cancer diagnosis is the relatively high success rate when treating patients.
