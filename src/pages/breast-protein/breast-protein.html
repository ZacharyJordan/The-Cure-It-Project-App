  There exists within nearly 20 percent of Breast Cancer patients an abnormal strain of HER2 proteins. This protein essentially drives up the growth of cancerous cells.

 While in the past this was something that worsened survival rates, recent research has all but eliminated this additonal risk and in doing so has saved countless lives. As medical oncologist Dr. Wendy Chen puts it, "HER2-directed therapies have revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer."

    <p class = "whiten">
A 2014 study titled Trastuzumab Plus Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2â€“Positive Breast Cancer unveiled some of the improvements in treatment that have been made in the past few years.

    <p class = "whiten">
They found that by combining Herceptin with chemotherapy survival rates could be improved significantly. In fact, 10 year-survival improved from 75 percent to 84 percent when the treatment was utilized. As for side effects, the most prominent where cardiac-related. These occured in around 3 percent of patients, and most recovered completely from the initial effects. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
     Additionally, a Phase III clinical trial demonstrated the possibility for a combination of HER2-targeted therapies to effectively combat HER2-positive Breast Cancers. While avaliable research on these combinations is limited, their existence is proof enough of the progess that is being made in terms of combatting dangerous subsets of Breast Cancer.
