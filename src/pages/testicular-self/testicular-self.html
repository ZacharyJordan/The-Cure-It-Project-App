    The promotion of self-examination has been one of the most important factors in the early discovery of Testicular Cancer. To understand this, one must first recognize the symptoms of Testicular Cancer.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     These can include, but are not limited to, things such as the enlargement of the testicle, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, a collection of fluid in the scrotum, and a persistent pain in the testicle or the scrotum.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 As you can probably tell, most of these symptoms are relatively visible and can, in some cases, be identified without the assistence of a medical professional. Thus, the testicular self-examination was standardized. For the sake of assisting people who are not familiar with the test, here are the American Cancer Society's guidlines as to how it should be performed: 
    </p>
    
     <p class = "whiten">
1. Hold your penis out of the way and check one testicle at a time. 
2. Hold the testicle between your thumbs and fingers of both hands and roll it gently between your fingers. 
3. Look and feel for any hard lumps or smooth rounded bumps or any change in the size, shape, or consistency of the testicles.
         
They also note that the best time to do this exam is during or after a bath or a shower. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
Because the stage at which the cancer is discovered is one of the most important factors in determining the effectiveness of treatment, the simple nature of this test has saved lives by enabling people to better discover the disease before it becomes life threatening. While the test is not 100 percent accurate, it can enable people to become aware of the problem where they otherwise would not.
