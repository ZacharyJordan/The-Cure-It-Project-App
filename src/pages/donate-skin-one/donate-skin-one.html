     Founded over 35 years ago, The Skin Cancer Foundation is currently the only international organization whose sole focus is improving the prevention and treatment of Skin Cancer.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
They are responsible for the distribution of millions of medically-reviewed pamphlets, posters, books, and newsletters annually, all of which contribute greatly to the goal of educating the public about the dangers of Skin Cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
The Skin Cancer Foundation has also been responsible for donating over 1.5 million dollars to over 150 boundary-pushing research projects. And as 90 percent of all funds are directed to the services that they provide, those who donate can rest assured that their money will be used to its full potential to fight Skin Cancers. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
The importance of this life-saving foundation cannot be overstated. Every dollar directed towards The Skin Cancer Foundation advances the fight against Skin Cancer, and serves to provide hope to the thousands that struggle with this terrible disease every day.
