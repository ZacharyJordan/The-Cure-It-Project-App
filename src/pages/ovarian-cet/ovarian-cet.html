    Common Epithelial Tumors (sometimes called CETs) are the most frequently observed form of Ovarian Cancers, making up around 90 percent of all diagnosed cases. There exists several other ways to classify diseases of this nature, the most common of which are through the distinction of Serous and Endometrioid tumors.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     erous tumors are the most common of all Epithelial tumors, making up about 2/3 of all cases diagnosed. New research has indicated that this cancer may not even start in the ovaries, instead originating in the cells of a nearby tube. It is discoveries such as this that allow scientists to better understand the disease, and thus treat it more effectively.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Endometrioid tumors are the next most common subset of Epithelial tumors. Recent research has indicated that when factors such as age and stage of the disease are taken into consideration, 5-year survival rates are comparable to those found in Serous cancer cases.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Thus, the major differences between these two diseases can be found by examining each on a molecular level. As with all forms of Ovarian Cancer, scientists agree that more research is necessary to meaningfully advance the way we treat Endometrioid Epithelial Cancer patients.
