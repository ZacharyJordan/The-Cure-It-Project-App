  The Light of Life Foundation is an organization that works tirelessly to improve the quality of life for Thyroid Cancer patients through the promotion of education of the general public as well as the establishment of improved research efforts within the medical community.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
Their mission is one of charity, and as such largely relies on the continued support of the public to achieve their selfless goals. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
The foundation was founded by Joan Shey, a former Thyroid Cancer patient who hopes to provide support for patients around the world through a system that is adaptive to their specific needs. This is something that she didn't have when she was first diagnosed with cancer in 1995. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
Through her leadership, the Light of Life Foundation hopes to raise money for research to support the development of new diagnostic and treatment initiatives for Thyroid Cancer. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
The prosperity and success that this foundation has enjoyed would be impossible without the support of the public. It is only the common person who is able to help fund research through this foundation, and help take a step in the right direction for subduing the threat of Thyroid Cancer once and for all.
