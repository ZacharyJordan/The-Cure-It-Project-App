    <p class = "whiten">
     Loosely defined, Endometiral Cancer is the uncontrollable growth of cells that originates in the lining of the womb (the uterus). There are two different types of Endometrial Cancers, Endometrial Carcinomas, and Uterine Sarcomas.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      Endromenial Cancer is highly treatable in all but its latest stages, with average 5-year survival rates only dipping below 50 percent in the later portions of stage III. Because Endometrial Cancers start in the uterus, or the cells that surround the uterus, the disease only affects females.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
 The threat of Endometiral Cancer can be long-term, with fertility being threatened in certain cases. The likelyhood of such an outcome increases when the cancer metastasizes (spreads) throughout the body.
