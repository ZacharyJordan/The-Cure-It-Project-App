   Although its application has been limited in recent years in favor of radiation therapy, surgery is sometimes used to treat certain forms of Eye cancers. The exception to this is Intraocular Lymphomas, where surgery is not an option due to the fact that the disease has almost certainly spread beyond the point of origin before such options are explored.

     Recent advancements have made it possible to replace the eyeball with orbital implants. The implant is usually made out of silicone or a substance similar to bone. It is attached to the muscles that previously were responsible for moving the eye, something that it will move in a similar manner as the eye would have.

 A few weeks after the surgery, the patient is then sent to visit an Ocularist to be fitted with an artificial eye. This artificial eye is a thin shell that fits over the orbital implant and underneath the eyelids.
    </p>
    
     <p class = "whiten">
The artificial eye typically matches the size and color of the remaining eye, thus making it difficult to tell apart from a real eye. Advancements such as these allow patients to live more normal lives after surgery, and ensure that the lingering damage of the cancer is minimized.
