        Bladder Cancer is one of the most common types of urinary cancers. 
      In 2014, there were approximately 75,000 diagnoses of Bladder Cancer. 
      There were 16,000 deaths, amounting to around 3% of all cancer related fatalities in that year.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      Unfortunately, the number of diagnoses has increased by nearly a quarter over the last decade. 
      This is largely due to the increase in the quality of medical equipment used to perform biopsies and find cancer 
      in the first place, as well as environmental carcinogens.
