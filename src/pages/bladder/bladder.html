      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Bladder Cancer is one of the most common types of urinary cancers. 
      In 2014, there were approximately 75,000 diagnoses of Bladder Cancer. 
      There were 16,000 deaths, amounting to around 3% of all cancer related fatalities in that year.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      Unfortunately, the number of diagnoses has increased by nearly a quarter over the last decade. 
      This is largely due to the increase in the quality of medical equipment used to perform biopsies and find cancer 
      in the first place, as well as environmental carcinogens. 
      </p>

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        This is by far the majority of all diagnosed Bladder Cancers, amounting to nearly 90% of all cases. Cells in the lining of the bladder often come into contact with toxic chemicals in urine waste. Since some of these chemicals are carcinogens, these cells can get damaged and form into tumors. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
        Over time, the cancer can spread into the tissue surrounding the bladder and metastasize from there. Almost all Bladder Cancers begin with transitional cell cancer, as these transitional cells are the most prone to contact with the body's waste. 
      </p>

      <span class = "whiten center-title-lower">Squamous Cell</span>
      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
       Squamous cells are specialized cells that line the vital internal organs of the body. Similarly to transitional cells, squamous cells regularly come into contact with the body's waste and are exposed to a whole host of toxins as a result.

      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
       When infected, they die quickly, so they are less prone to growing out of control and becoming cancerous than transitional cells. Squamous cells are identified by their spongy nature and flat, rectangular shape.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Recent years have yielded advances in treatment of Bladder Cancer. One of the most promising is the application of photodynamic therapy. This practice involves injecting small, light-sensitive chemicals into the bloodstream of a patient.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      These chemicals accrue along the lining of the bladder and “stick” to cancerous cells. Then, physicians can fire high-intensity light at the PDT chemicals, causing them to morph into a new chemical that is toxic to cancer cells.

      <br />
      <p class = "whiten">
        Intravesical immunotherapy is a promising new style of Bladder Cancer treatment. Doctors administer drugs to a patient’s bladder by directly introducing them via a catheter instead of giving the patient a pill or an injection.
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
      This method can be used to deliver chemotherapy drugs, but is more commonly used for delivering immunotherapy drugs.
