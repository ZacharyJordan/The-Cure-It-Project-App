Although the chance for lung collapse does exist, this problem usually be effectively dealt with in a matter of days by inserting a tube between the collapsed lung and the chest wall. The vast majority of patients are able to resume their normal lives about a week after the surgery, and only 1 in 10 patients report experiencing pain after this same timeframe.
