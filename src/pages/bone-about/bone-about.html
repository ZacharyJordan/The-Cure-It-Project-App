    <p class = "whiten">
     Bone Cancer is described as the uncontrollable growth of cells that originates in areas with bones or bone related cells. Bone Cancer is one of the more frightening forms of cancer due to the ease with which it can spread.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      There are 3 primary types of Bone Cancers: Osteosarcomas, Ewing Tumors (ET), and Chondrosarcomas. All of these will be discussed in great detail below. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
  Bone Cancers, as the name implies, are abnormal clusters of cells that originate within bones. One reason that these cells are dangerous is because they lead to the death of normal bone tissue. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
However, another danger comes at the ease with which this cancer can metastasize, or spread, around the body. Since bones exist in practically every system and area of the body, this disease has the potential to be spread almost anywhere.
