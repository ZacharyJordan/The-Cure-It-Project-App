     This is by far the majority of all diagnosed Bladder Cancers, amounting to nearly 90% of all cases. Cells in the lining of the bladder often come into contact with toxic chemicals in urine waste. 
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
Since some of these chemicals are carcinogens, these cells can get damaged and form into tumors. Over time, the cancer can spread into the tissue surrounding the bladder and metastasize from there. Almost all Bladder Cancers begin with transitional cell cancer, as these transitional cells are the most prone to contact with the body's waste.

<p class = "whiten">
The chances of developing transitional Cell Bladder Cancer can be offset by avoiding certain risk factors. The greatest controllable risk factor is smoking. Smokers can have up to a fourfold increase in the likelihood of developing Bladder Cancer. 
</p>

  In fact, about 50% of Bladder Cancer in the United States is thought to be caused, in part, by cigarette smoking. The nicotine in cigarettes breaks down into compounds known as nitrosamines when burned, a substance known to be a carcinogen.
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
  Since the lining of the bladder wall replaces itself at a high rate, old age simply increases the chances of cells not reproducing properly and causing the growth of malignant tumors. People who have had cancer in the past are also at an elevated risk, as the treatment drug Cytoxan is known to increase the risk of Bladder Cancer specifically. 
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
Transitional Cell Bladder Cancer can be either low-grade or high-grade. Low-grade carcinomas are the most treatable, as the cancer has stayed with the transitional cells on the surface layer of the bladder only. IVI Therapy is especially good at eliminating this. 
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
But the problem becomes much more severe in high-grade transitional cell carcinomas. In this case, the cancer has spread past the surface layer of the bladder and into the fibrous muscle tissue around it.
</p>

<p class = "whiten">
From there, the cancer can be carried away through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. Almost every death from Bladder Cancer is due to these high-grade transitional cell cancers.
