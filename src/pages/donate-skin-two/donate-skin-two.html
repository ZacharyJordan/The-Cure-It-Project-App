    The American Skin Association has spent the past two decades fighting against Skin Cancers through the application of research grants and public outreach programs. They seek to make sure that everyone, regardless of race, age, or social status, has the opportunity to recieve education regarding the dangers of skin diseases and what can be done to prevent them. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
Their active approach in combating these deadly diseases has led them to donate over 7.9 million dollars in advanced dermatological reasearch, something that they argue is "the key to earlier diagnosis, less invasive therapies and, in time, prevention and cure." 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
This money has supported the work of 150 investigators, something which ensures that a broad range of research in regards to Skin Cancer is achieved. 
      </p>

      <p class = "whiten">
They also boast an impressive degree of financial transparency, with audited financial statements and IRS Form 990 filings dated back as far as 2006 publically avaliable. Additionally, they provide a detailed expenses breakdown which enables all those who donate to scrutinize where their money is actually going.
