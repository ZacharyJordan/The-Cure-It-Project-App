    Retinoblastomas are a form of Eye Cancer that is found exclusively in children under the age of 5. Although Retinoblastomas are by no means common, their influence demands attention. They are usually contracted as a result of a mutation in a gene referred to in the scientific community as the RB gene.

     In order to understand Retinoblastoma, we must first discuss what it actually is. A brief overview of eye functions and anatomy reveals that the retina is the part of the eye that takes in light from the world around us, transforming this light into electrical impulses that that brain can decode through a process called transduction. Therefore, Retinoblastomas can be thought of as cancer of the retina.

 When a baby is growing in the womb, the eyes are one of the first things to develop. In these very early stages the eyes have cells called Retinoblasts that grow very quickly. When they stop growing, they develop into mature retinal cells that can detect and process light.

     However, in very rare cases the immature Retinoblasts continue to grow very fast and do not turn into mature retinal cells. Instead they grow out of control and develop into cancerous tumors known as Retinoblastomas.

     is of the utmost importance to find this cancer during the pre-natal stage of growth in order to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the body after birth. Symptoms of the cancer can sometimes become very agressive, involving the constant dilation of the pupils, blood vessel rupture, and complete loss of eyesight. These symptoms typically occur in one eye, but since Retinoblastomas are inheritable, it could occur in both eyes as a result of genetic mutation.
