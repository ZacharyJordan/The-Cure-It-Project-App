  The Bone Cancer Research Trust has been dedicated to stopping the spread of Bone Cancer since its inception in 2006.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Their goals are ambitious, with plans to support the research of advanced Bone Cancers, raise awareness about the disease, enhance general knowledge about its influence, and to provide support for patients that already have it. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
The Bone Cancer Research Trust has funded 35 peer-reviewed research projects since 2006. The amount of money donated totals Â£1,392,731, which equates to roughly $2,114,792. This tremendous sum of money has all gone towards the betterment of conditions for Bone Cancer patients, and has proved to be tremendously successful in that respect.

You can take them one step further in their fight by donating money to their cause. Each and every dollar brings Bone Cancer one step closer to its demise.
