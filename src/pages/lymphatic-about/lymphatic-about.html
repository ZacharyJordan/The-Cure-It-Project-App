     Lymphoma is classified as the uncontrollable growth of a specific type of white blood cell called a lymphatic cell. It is a variant of Blood Cancer, but possesses enough unique properties to warrant individual analysis. There are 2 main types of Lymphatic Cancers: Hodgkin's Disease, and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

    <p class = "whiten">
      Because Lymphoma affects the lymphatic system, it poses a direct threat to the immune system. This is because lymphatic cells are a type of white blood cell. When functioning properly, these cells usually attack pathogens, bacteria, and viruses the moment they enter the body.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
  Once these white blood cells are mutated through Lymphatic Cancers, the body begins to have difficulty fighting off even small viruses like mild colds. This has the effect of turning mild conditions into severe medical crises.
