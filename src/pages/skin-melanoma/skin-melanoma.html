    Melanoma is a form of cancer that begins in the Melanocytes, the portion of the skin responsible for producing Melanin and controlling skin color. While Melanoma is the most rare form of Skin Cancer, accounting for less than 2 percent of all cases diagnosed per year, it is also the most deadly.

     Although it can almost always be cured if caught in its earlier stages, the aggressive nature of the disease ensures that this window of corrective opportunity remains very small.

    <p class = "whiten">
 The issue of Melanoma is a pressing one, especially when once considers that diagnosal rates of this terrible disease have been steadily increasing in the United States for over 30 years. In fact, there are currently over 960,000 people living with Melanoma Skin Cancer in the United States right now. Additionally worth noting is that while Melanoma can occur in both younger and older people, the risk of contracting this disease increase with age.

    <p class = "whiten">
     One major difficulty with achieving an early treatement of Melanoma is the degree to which it can remain dormant for long periods of time. One way that this can happen is in the form of a skin mole.

    <p class = "whiten">
     While the vast majority of moles will never turn into anything harmful, some still do, and it is this casual gap that researches are trying to close in the hopes that it will save lives through the early discovery of this disease.
