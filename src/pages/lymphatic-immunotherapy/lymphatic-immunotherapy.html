    In its most basic form, immunotherapy is the practice of applying the immune system to combat the development and spread of cancerous cells. While such therapies have existed for some time now, recent developments have made this form of treatment significantly more effective and comfortable for the patient when applied against Lymphatic Cancers.

    One such development has been the further application of vaccines to better help the immune system respond to the presence of cancerous cells. An example of this can be seen through Dendritic cell vaccines. It has been noted as the most successful attempt at utilizing vaccines as a means of combating cancer thus far, and works by helping the immune system to recognize cancerous cells.

This allows the body to tell the difference between healthy cells and cells that need to be destroyed, and in doing so enables the patient to better combat cancerous cells without the extended application of harmful drugs.

However, there do exist flaws in the practical application of such medical technologies. For instance, many patients that are treated with such vaccines fail to respond in a meaningful manner.

    <p class = "whiten">
As with all emerging technologies, the process for undergoing them is incredibly complex and expensive, something that has limited their application significantly. That said, medical professionals remain hopeful that further research will produce results that are able to assist increasingly large amounts of people.
