  Sarcomas are cancers that develop in the bone or muscle. The growth of this cancer causes pressure on the body and organs that can sometimes result in the infected cells being spread around the body. While they technically have the potential to spread to nearly any site in the body, the most common place to spread is to the lungs or bones.

 Like all forms of Colorectal Cancers, early detection is the key to ensuring a quick and efficient treatment. The earlier the cancer is discovered, the less likely it is to have spread, thus allowing for the removal of the cancerous cells through surgeries.

However, more complex cases of Sarcoma may mean that radiotherapy and chemotherapy must be used in order to reduce the tumor in size before surgery.
