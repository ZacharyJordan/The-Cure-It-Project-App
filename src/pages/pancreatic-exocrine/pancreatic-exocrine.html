    Exocrine Tumors are easily the most common form of Pancreatic Cancers. Because of this, a diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer is almost always referring to this specific type of tumor. Formulating a working knowledge of the differences between Exocrine and Endocrine Tumors is important due to the differences in prognosis and methods of treatment that each subset of the disease demands.

    <p class = "whiten">
     The exocrine glands are responsible for the creation of substances which contain enzymes that help digest food in the body. If these glands did not exist, the body would have a difficult time extracting energy from the food that passes through its systems. The enzymes that are created get released into tubes called ducts. These tiny ducts merge to form larger ducts, which eventually empty into the pancreatic duct.

    <p class = "whiten">
 The tumors created by Exocrine Cancers block these passageways, restricting and sometimes even completely cutting off the flow of these tubes, which hinders the ability of certain organs to function properly due to the lack of necessary enzymes and hormones.

    <p class = "whiten">
     The thing that makes Exocrine Cancers so deadly is the fact that they are often connected to virtually every single major system in the body. Recall that the enzymes and hormones produced by the pancreas travel to other orgnas to make them function. This provides the malignant tumors access to these organs, which is a primary reason why it is able to metastasize (spread) so quickly.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Additionally, Exocrine Cancers are often rather difficult to detect before they develop advanced stages. This is, at least in part, due to the fast rate of metastasis that the disease has when compared to other forms of cancer. This is something that can make effective treatment a challenge.
