   Chemotherapy has always served as a valuable tool for doctors and patients alike to combat Oral Cancers. However, the side effects that this form of treatment can sometimes have has attached a negative stigma to the practice, something which has made some patients apprehensive to attempting it.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Thankfully, recent advancements have brought with them new applications of chemotherapy that are both better suited for targeting cancerous tumors and more comfortable for those that must experience it.

    <p class = "whiten">
 One recent approach involves injecting the chemotherapy drug directly into the tumor. While in the past this approach sometimes led to the drug quickly spreading throughout the body, recent advancements have made it possible to prepare the chemotherapy drugs so that they remain in the tumor, thus ensuring a more comfortable and active treatment.

Additionally, chemotherapy for Oral Cancers is sometimes used as a supplement to other treatments, ultimately aiming to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiotherapy. This means we are sometimes able to slowly ween off our dependance on chemotherapy and the many harms that have historically come along with it.
