    <p class = "whiten">
     Ovarian Cancer is a form of cancer that begins in the ovaries. The ovaries, found exclusively in females, are responsible for maintaining the health of the reproductve system and ensuring fertility. There are several types of Ovarian Cancers that we will cover in detail. These are Common Epithelial Tumors, Germ Cell Tumors, and Stromal Tumors.

      Perhaps the defining factor that makes Ovarian Cancer so dangerous is the fact that early detection of the disease is often very difficult. In fact, only about 19 percent of Ovarian cancer cases are detected before the cancer has spread beyond the point of origin, something which makes these cases substantially more difficult to treat.

  This is caused in part because of the small size of the ovaries - each ovary is only about the size of a grape. Additionally, the symptoms that define this cancer are non-specific to the disease and can sometimes be interpreted as being something less serious.
