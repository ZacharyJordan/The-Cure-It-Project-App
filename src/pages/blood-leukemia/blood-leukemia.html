     Leukemia is a form of Cancer that begins in the tissue that generates blood for the body. Leukemia turns a person's bone marrow against them, altering it to produce abnormal white blood cells.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
      These cells are called Leukemia cells, and their presence makes it challenging for normal blood cells to function properly. This lack of proper functioning is where many of the health harms of Leukemia come from. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   In order to grasp a thorough understanding of what living with Leukemia entails, we must first analyze the symptoms that spawn from it. Early identification of these symptoms is essential in terms of ensuring that the problem is dealt with effectively.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    While none of these symptoms are cause for significant alarm when isolated, the accumulation of many of them can be indiciative of the early stages of Leukemia. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
    To provide a non-exhaustive list, symptoms include: fatigue, fevers, chills, cold sweats, frequent infections, easy bruising, and weight loss. These symptoms can make everyday tasks such as walking around or enjoying a meal incredibly difficult to accomplish, especially when one factors in the side-effects that treatement may have on an individual. 
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
   Due to the slow-moving nature of Leukemia, many do not register the symptoms as being significant right away. This means that they do not interpret these symptoms as being cancerous, which can lead to dangerous consequences in the long term.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
      With every passing day comes another opportunity for the person's body to generate more dangerous white blood cells. As a result of this, an additional danger of Leukemia lies within its tendancy to remain undiscovered until after the body has produced enough cells to disturb the natural balance of white and red blood cells.
