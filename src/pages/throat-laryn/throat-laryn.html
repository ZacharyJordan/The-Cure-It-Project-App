     This is one of the two main forms of throat cancer. The cancer starts in the larynx which is located above the opening to the trachea (windpipe). The larynx is most well-known as the voice box because your vocal chords are here but also serves to shut your throat from food or water entering the lungs and helps you breathe.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
    Almost all cancer in the larynx forms because of flat and thin cells (squamous cells). The malignant squamous cells cover the larynx and growth of even more cells can result in the numerous amounts of symptoms listed above. Carcinogens can increase the risk of these cells forming.

  The chances of developing Laryngeal Cancer is very low, affecting 3.2 per 100,00 men and women per year, but it is important to treat it early by getting a diagnosis. Biopsies of the throat, or taking sample tissue from an area of your body, can be used to test if there are cancerous cells in the throat.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
   Because the larynx is located deep in one’s body, special forms of head and neck exams can be taken to retrieve and test tissues for cancer. Also, avoidance of controllable factors like cigarettes can greatly reduce the risk of obtaining laryngeal cancer. The risk of a current or past heavy smoker developing Laryngeal Cancer is about 40 times the risk of Laryngeal Cancer of a non smoker.

   Laryngeal Cancer growth is examined through the TNM system. The system measures for T (Tumor), N (Node), and M (Metastasis) with different stages in each measurement. Each of these “letters” have several stages in them with varying degrees of severity.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
    The T function checks the size of the primary tumor. Next, the N function checks whether the lymph nodes have cancer cells in them. The M function has two levels, 0 and 1, meaning cancer hasn’t spread and cancer has spread to other places like the lung, respectively. From there, doctors can determine the grade (1,2,3) of the cancer in increasing severity.
