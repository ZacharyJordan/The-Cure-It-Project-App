    Endometrial Carcinomas are cancers that begin in the inner lining of the uterus. The uterus is composed of two distinct layers: the inner layer is the endometrium, and the outer layer is the myometrium. Encometrial Carcinomas are defined as the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in the endometrium.

     Many scientists have come to the conclusion that this form of Endometrial Cancer is due to an abnormally high presence of estrogen in the body. The medical outlook associated with this form of cancer is generally positive, with the majority of healthy glands being preserved in the earlier stages of the cancer.

 This, combined with the relatively unaggressive nature of the cancer, can sometimes result in a failure to recognize the potential danger that the disease holds, as type I Endometrial Cancers typically do metastasize (spread) fairly easily.

    Many of the symptoms of Endometrial Carcinomas are quite visible, with a major indicator being defined by the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding. This can involve anything from a drastic change in the duration of a period or the time that passes in between periods.

     While such symptoms are not always indicative of Endometrial Carcinomas, it is important to get these issues examined by a medical professional to prevent future problems.
