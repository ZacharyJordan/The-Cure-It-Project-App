  Founded over 40 years ago, The American Brain Tumor Association was the first nonprofit organization in the world to set its sights solely on eliminating the risk of Brain Tumors.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Every dollar donated to them is used to not only pursue breakthroughs in Brain Cancer diagnosis, but also to support the needs of both patients and those that look after them. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Their intellectual credibility is protected by a scientific advisory council that consists of over 30 top researchers well-versed in the topic of Brain Cancers. Beyond advising the American Brain Tumor Association on the scientific trends worth noting, the council also makes funding recommendations to make sure that every dollar donated has the opportunity to contribute to the saving of innocent life. 
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
The importance of their life-saving research simply cannot be overstated. A donation directed towards this organization is a donation to turn the tables on cancer, and to better the odds of the hundreds of thousands of people that must battle this terrible illness each and every day.
