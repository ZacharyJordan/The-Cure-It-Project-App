    The second type of throat cancer is Hypopharyngeal Cancer which exists the pharynx. The pharynx like the larynx exists in the throat but also in the back of nasal cavity covering three areas called the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx.

    <p class = "whiten">
      The hypopharynx helps make sure that food goes around the larynx and goes to the esophagus. Also, like Laryngeal Cancer, the cancer in the pharynx is caused by flat squamous cells that irregularly multiply out of control and form tumors that can grow to other parts of the body.

  The risk factors of alcohol, tobacco, and age are the same, yet Hypopharyngeal Cancer occurs less frequently than Laryngeal Cancer, affecting 2,500 people every year.

  The cancer growth is examined through the same TNM system, but the only difference exists in the T functions. The T function for Hypopharyngeal Cancer looks if tumors have formed in Pyriform sinuses, side and back parts of the hypopharyngeal walls, and in the location where the throat and esophagus meet. In addition, the T function for this cancer also looks for the size of the tumors.
