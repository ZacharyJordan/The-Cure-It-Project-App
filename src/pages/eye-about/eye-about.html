    <p class = "whiten">
     Eye cancers are tumorous growths found in the ocular region of the head. The threat of Eye Cancer is one that has grown over the past couple of years, in part due to their tendancy to spread to other parts of the body relatively quickly when compared to other diseases. There are three primary types of Eye Cancers that we will be covering. They are Intraocular Melanomas, Intraocular Lymphomas, and Retinoblastomas.

    <p class = "whiten">
      Eye Cancers are relatively uncommon on a global scale, occuring in just 5 to 7.5 people out of every million people in the United States and Europe. The reach of the disease technically extends to everyone, but Eye Cancers are far more prominent in males over the age of 55.

  Although the rare nature of the disease is certainly a positive thing, it does little to make the experience of suffering from Eye Cancer more pleasant for those who already have it.
