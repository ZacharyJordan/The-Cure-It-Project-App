  Adenocarcinomas are by far the most common form of Colorectal Cancer, claiming 95 percent of diagnosal cases. This form of cancer often begins in the inner layer of the bowel before spreading into other, deeper layers. Because of this, early detection and treatment is essential in terms of ensuring that the cancer does not become life threatening.

    <p class = "whiten">
  There are several types of Adenocarcinomas, but the most dangerous are Signet Ring Cell Adenocarcinomas. While these only account for less than one percent of all Adenocarcinomas, they are typically very agressive. They are very difficult to treat in the vast majority of cases.

    <p class = "whiten">
 This is a very common form of cancer, with well over 100,000 cases occuring each year in the United States alone. While the lethality of this form of cancer varies greatly on the time in which it is detected, an average of 50 percent of patients survive 5 years of more after contracting the disease.
    </p>

    <p class = "whiten">
Survival rates in patients that achieve early detection are more comforting, with anywhere from 70 to 80 percent of these patients reaching this same milestone. That said, more research is required to ensure that these promising odds are afforded to all Adenocarcinoma patients.
