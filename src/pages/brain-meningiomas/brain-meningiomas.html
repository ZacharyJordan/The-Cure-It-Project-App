    Meningiomas are, simply put, tumors that arise from the coverings of the brain and spinal cord. They typically are found on the outer curve and top of the brain. Meningiomas are fairly common, accounting for nearly a third of all Primary Brain Cancers.

    In order to truly grasp what it is like to live with a Meningioma, one must first consider the symptoms that those suffering from it sometimes experience. While the symptoms vary in relation to the position and size of the tumor in the brain, some common ones include headaches, weakness, and personality changes.

  One major issue with the discovery of Meningiomas is the degree to which they can remain dormant for long periods of time, growing silently until they become too large to stop. While they grow relatively slowly, they often reach fairly large sizes before altering the typical functioning of the brain, something which makes early treatment of Meningiomas a challenge.
