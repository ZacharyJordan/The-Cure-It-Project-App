   A Thyroidectomy involves the removal of all of most of the thyroid in an attempt to halt the advancement of cancerous cells.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">

The aftercare of this treatment, while disruptive and long lasting in its effect, is generally considered by most medical professionals to be an important part in ensuring a safe recovery.
