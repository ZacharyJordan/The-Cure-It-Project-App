   Your throat and parts of your mouth are covered with many flat squamous cells. Contracting Squamous Cell Carcinoma means that some of these cells have become abnormal and are now actively fighting against the body.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     Squamous Cell Carcinomas are a relatively pervasive problem, with over 30,000 people being effected by it each year in the United States alone. This means that Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas account for 2.5 percent of all cancer cases in the United States.

    <p class = "whiten">
 Perhaps the most tragic thing about Squamous Cell Carcinomas is how preventable they can often be. In fact, the single largest risk factor that has been identified for this form of cancer is active engagement in smoking and the consumption of alchohol.

    <p class = "whiten">
     Less preventable is the role that age plays in the prominence of the disease, with the majority of Squamous Cell Carcinoma victims being above the age of 40. However, refusing to partake in active smoking and drinking can play a tremendous role in decreasing the likelihood of ever having to endure a case of Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
    </p>
    
    <p class = "whiten">
     The lethality of this form of cancer depends heavily on the location in which it is first contracted. For instance, Squamous Cell Carcinomas that develop on the tounge or the floor of the mouth can have a 5 year survial rate as low as 50 percent, with an additional possibility of spreading to other parts of the body. Carcinomas that appear on the lower lip, however, typically have a much higher survival rate, with 9 out of every 10 people surviving 5 years of more.
