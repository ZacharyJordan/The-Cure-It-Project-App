   While Uterine Sarcomas are far less common than Endometrial Carcinomas, they share so much in common that comparisons between them are inevitable. Like Endometrial Carcinomas, Euterine Sarcomas typically originate in the endometrium.

    <p class = "whiten">
    They are often much more aggressive than Endometiral Carcinomas, something that explains why they are often refered to as the 2nd form of Endometrial Carcinomas. Because of this, Uterine Sarcomas are more likely to spread throughout the body.

Thankfully, the many symptoms that indicate the presence of Uterine Sarcomas are relatively visible and as a result make it easier to detect this form of cancer before advanced development can be achieved. These include: vaginal bleeding, pain in the cervix, massive weight loss, and widespread fatiuge.
