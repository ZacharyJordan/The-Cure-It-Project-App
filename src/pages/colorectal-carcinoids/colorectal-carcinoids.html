  Carcinoids are an especially slow growing form of Colorectal Cancer. While this has the advantage of ensuring that the tumor is not especially fast-acting, it can also make early detection a challenge. Carcinoids often fail to produce symptoms until late in the disease, something which can mean that the tumor is advanced at the time of discovery.

    <p class = "whiten">
 Early detection of Carcinoids can sometimes make treatment a relatively simple manner, with a targeted surgery removing or preventing the further development of the tumor. However, the low-profile nature of the cancer typically means that more advanced treatment plans are necessary, such as through medications, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

 Although recent advancements have yielded improvements in this regard, these treatment plans are often uncomfortable for the patient due to the slew of negative side effects that they involve.
